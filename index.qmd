## The aim of this book {.unnumbered}

The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research.
R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting.
It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R but simply to help you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your experience in using R.

## How to use this book {.unnumbered}

For the best experience we recommend that you read the web version of this book which you can find [here][book].
The web version includes a navbar at the top of the page where you can toggle the sidebars on and off, search through the book, change the page color and suggest revisions if you spot a typo or mistake.
You can also download a pdf and epub versions of the book.

We use a few typographical conventions throughout this book.

R code and the resulting output are presented in code blocks in our book.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

Functions in the text are shown with brackets at the end using code font, i.e.
`mean()` or `sd()` etc.

Objects are shown using code font without the round brackets, i.e.
`obj1`, `obj2` etc.

A series of actions required to access menu commands in RStudio or VSCode are identified as `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script` which translates to 'click on the File menu, then click on New File and then select R Script'.

## Thanks {.unnumbered}

This book started as a fork on github from the excellent [An introduction to R](https://intro2r.com/) book by Douglas, Roos, Mancini, Couto and Lusseau [@douglas2023].
It was forked on April 23rd, 2023 from [Alexd106 github repository](https://github.com/alexd106/Rbook) then modified and updated following my own needs and teaching perspective of R.
This also a part of a multilingual R book project to improve equity and diversity. It started wiuth a french translation and wwas/will be extended to many more languages.
