## The aim of this book {.unnumbered}

The aim of this book is to introduce you to using R, a powerful and flexible interactive environment for statistical computing and research.
R in itself is not difficult to learn, but as with learning any new language (spoken or computer) the initial learning curve can be a little steep and somewhat daunting.
It is not intended to cover everything there is to know about R but simply to help you climb the initial learning curve and provide you with the basic skills and experience (and confidence!) to enable you to further your experience in using R.

## How to use this book {.unnumbered}

For the best experience we recommend that you read the web version of this book which you can find [here][book].
The web version includes a navbar at the top of the page where you can toggle the sidebars on and off, search through the book, change the page color and suggest revisions if you spot a typo or mistake.
You can also download a pdf and epub versions of the book.

We use a few typographical conventions throughout this book.

R code and the resulting output are presented in code blocks in our book.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
2 + 2
```

Functions in the text are shown with brackets at the end using code font, i.e.
`mean()` or `sd()` etc.

Objects are shown using code font without the round brackets, i.e.
`obj1`, `obj2` etc.

A series of actions required to access menu commands in RStudio or VSCode are identified as `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script` which translates to 'click on the File menu, then click on New File and then select R Script'.

## Some R pointers {.unnumbered}

- Use R often and use it regularly.
This will help build and maintain all important momentum.
- Learning R is not a memory test.
One of advantage of a scripting language is that you will always have your (well annotated) code to refer back to when you forget how to do something.
- You don't need to know everything about R to be productive.
- If you get stuck, search online, it's not cheating and writing a good search query is a skill in itself.
- If you find yourself staring at code for hours trying to figure out why it's not working then walk away for a few minutes.
- In R there are many ways to tackle a particular problem.
If your code does what you want it to do in a reasonable time and robustly then don't worry about it.
- R is just a tool to help you answer your interesting questions.
Don't lose sight of what's important - your research question(s) and your data.
No amount of skill using R will help if your data collection is fundamentally flawed or your question vague.
- Recognize that there will be times when things will get a little tough or frustrating.
Try to accept these periods as part of the natural process of learning a new skill (we've all been there) and remember, the time and energy you invest now will be more than payed back in the not too distant future.

Good luck and don’t forget to have fun.

## Thanks {.unnumbered}

This book started as a fork on github from the excellent [An introduction to R](https://intro2r.com/) book by Douglas, Roos, Mancini, Couto and Lusseau [@douglas2023].
It was forked on April 23rd, 2023 from [Alexd106 github repository](https://github.com/alexd106/Rbook) then modified and updated following my own needs and teaching perspective of R.
This also a part of a multilingual R book project to improve equity and diversity. It started wiuth a french translation and wwas/will be extended to many more languages.
