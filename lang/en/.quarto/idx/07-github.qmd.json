{"title":"Version control with Git and GitHub","markdown":{"headingText":"Version control with Git and GitHub","headingAttr":{"id":"sec-github_r","classes":[],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis Chapter will introduce you to the basics of using a version control system to keep track of all your important R code and facilitate collaboration with colleagues and the wider world.\nThis Chapter will focus on using the software 'Git' in combination with the web-based hosting service 'GitHub'.\nBy the end of the Chapter, you will be able to install and configure Git and GitHub on your computer and setup and work with a version controlled project in RStudio.\nWe won't be covering more advanced topics such as branching, forking and pull requests in much detail but we do give an overview later in @sec-collab.\n\nJust a few notes of caution.\nIn this Chapter we'll be using RStudio to interface with Git as it gives you a nice friendly graphical user interface which generally makes life a little bit easier (and who doesn't want that?).\nHowever, one downside to using RStudio with Git is that RStudio only provides pretty basic Git functionality through its menu system.\nThat's fine for most of what we'll be doing during this Chapter (although we will introduce a few Git commands as we go along) but if you really want to benefit from using Git's power you will need to learn some Git commands (see @sec-resources) and syntax and change for another IDE such as [VSCode][vscode] which is much much better when it comes to integration with github.\nGit can become a little bewildering and frustrating when you first start using it.\nThis is mostly due to the terminology and liberal use of jargon associated with Git, but there's no hiding the fact that it's quite easy to get yourself and your Git repository into a pickle.\nTherefore, we've tried hard to keep things as straight forward as we can during this Chapter and as a result we do occasionally show you a couple of very 'un-Git' ways of doing things (mostly about reverting to previous versions of documents).\nDon't get hung up about this, there's no shame to using these low tech solutions and if it works then it works.\nLastly, GitHub was not designed to host very large files and will warn you if you try to add files greater than 50 MB and block you adding files greater than 100 MB.\nIf your project involves using large file sizes there are a [few solutions][biggit] but we find the easiest solution is to host these files elsewhere (Googledrive, Dropbox etc) and create a link to them in a README file or R markdown document on Github.\n \n\n## What is version control?\n\nA [Version Control System][version_con] (VCS)  keeps a record of all the changes you make to your files that make up a particular project and allows you to revert to previous versions of files if you need to.\nTo put it another way, if you muck things up or accidentally lose important files you can easily roll back to a previous stage in your project to sort things out.\nVersion control was originally designed for collaborative software development, but it's equally useful for scientific research and collaborations (although admittedly a lot of the terms, jargon and functionality are focused on the software development side).\nThere are many different version control systems currently available, but we' we'll focus on using *Git*, because it's free and open source and it integrates nicely with RStudio.\nThis means that its can easily become part of your usual workflow with minimal additional overhead.\n \n\n## Why use version control?\n\nSo why should you worry about version control? Well, first of all it helps avoid this (familiar?) situation when you're working on a project\nusually arising from this (familiar?) scenario.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-youNeedVC2\n#| fig-cap: \"Why you need version control (source: [PhDComics](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531))\"\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/final_doc.png\")\n```\n\n\nVersion control automatically takes care of keeping a record of all the versions of a particular file and allows you to revert back to previous versions if you need to.\nVersion control also helps you (especially the future you) keep track of all your files in a single place and it helps others (especially collaborators) review, contribute to and reuse your work through the GitHub website.\nLastly, your files are always available from anywhere and on any computer, all you need is an internet connection.\n\n## What is Git and GitHub?\n\n**Git** is a version control system originally developed by [Linus Torvalds][linus] that lets you track changes to a set of files.\nThese files can be any type of file including the menagerie of files that typically make up a data orientated project (.pdf, .Rmd, .docx, .txt, .jpg etc) although plain text files work the best.\nAll the files that make up a project is called a **repository** (or just **repo**).\n\n**GitHub** is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories which allows you to create a remote copy of your local version-controlled project.\nThis can be used as a backup or archive of your project or make it accessible to you and to your colleagues so you can work collaboratively.\n\nAt the start of a project we typically (but not always) create a **remote** repository on GitHub, then **clone** (think of this as copying) this repository to our **local** computer (the one in front of you).\nThis cloning is usually a one time event and you shouldn't need to clone this repository again unless you really muck things up.\nOnce you have cloned your repository you can then work locally on your project as usual, creating and saving files for your data analysis (scripts, R markdown documents, figures etc).\nAlong the way you can take snapshots (called **commits**) of these files after you've made important changes.\nWe can then **push** these changes to the remote GitHub repository to make a backup or make available to our collaborators.\nIf other people are working on the same project (**repository**), or maybe you're working on a different computer, you can **pull** any changes back to your local repository so everything is synchronised.\n         \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-git-cart\n#| fig-cap: How git works\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/Github_cartoon2.png\")\n```\n\n\n## Getting started {#sec-setup_git}\n\nThis Chapter assumes that you have already installed the latest versions of R and an IDE (RStudio or VSCode).\nIf you haven't done this yet you can find instructions in @sec-install_r.\n\n### Install Git\n\nTo get started, you first need to install Git.\nIf you're lucky you may already have Git installed (especially if you have a Mac or Linux computer).\nYou can check if you already have Git installed by clicking on the `Terminal tab` in RStudio and typing `git --version`.\nIf you see something that looks like `git version 2.25.0` (the version number may be different on your computer) then you already have Git installed (happy days).\nIf you get an error (something like `git: command not found`) this means you don't have Git installed (yet!).\n\nYou can also do this check outside RStudio by opening up a separate Terminal if you want.\nOn Windows go to the 'Start menu' and in the search bar (or run box) type `cmd` and press enter.\nOn a Mac go to 'Applications' in Finder, click on the 'Utilities' folder and then on the 'Terminal' program.\nOn a Linux machine simply open the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T often does it).\n \n\nTo install Git on a **Windows** computer we recommend you download and install Git for Windows (also known as 'Git Bash').\nYou can find the download file and installation instructions [here][git].\n\nFor those of you using a **Mac** computer we recommend you download Git from [here][git] and install in the usual way (double click on the installer package once downloaded).\nIf you've previously installed Xcode on your Mac and want to use a more up to date version of Git then you will need to follow a few more steps documented [here][git_xcode].\nIf you've never heard of Xcode then don't worry about it!\n\nFor those of you lucky enough to be working on a **Linux** machine you can simply use your OS package manager to install Git from the official repository.\nFor Ubuntu Linux (or variants of) open your Terminal and type\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\n```\n\nYou will need administrative privileges to do this.\nFor other versions of Linux see [here][git-linux] for further installation instructions.\n \n\nWhatever version of Git you're installing, once the installation has finished verify that the installation process has been successful by running the command `git --version` in the Terminal tab in RStudio (as described above).\nOn some installations of Git (yes we're looking at you MS Windows) this may still produce an error as you will also need to setup RStudio so it can find the Git executable (described  in @sec-rs_config).\n\n### Configure Git\n\nAfter installing Git, you need to configure it so you can use it.\nClick on the Terminal tab in the Console window again and type the following:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global user.email 'you@youremail.com'\n\ngit config --global user.name 'Your Name'\n```\n\nsubstituting `'Your Name'` for your actual name and `'you@youremail.com'` with your email address.\nWe recommend you use your University email address (if you have one) as you will also use this address when you register for your GitHub account (coming up in a bit).\n \n\nIf this was successful, you should see no error messages from these commands.\nTo verify that you have successfully configured Git type the following into the Terminal\n\n```bash\ngit config --global --list\n```\n\nYou should see both your `user.name` and `user.email` configured.\n\n### Configure RStudio {#sec-rs_config}\n\nAs you can see above, Git can be used from the command line, but it also integrates well with RStudio, providing a friendly graphical user interface.\nIf you want to use RStudio's Git integration (we recommend you do - at least at the start), you need to check that the path to the Git executable is specified correctly.\nIn RStudio, go to the menu `Tools` -> `Global Options` -> `Git/SVN` and make sure that 'Enable version control interface for RStudio projects' is ticked and that the 'Git executable:' path is correct for your installation.\nIf it's not correct hit the `Browse...` button and navigate to where you installed git and click on the executable file.\nYou will need to restart RStudio after doing this.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-git-rs\n#| fig-cap: Providing path to git software in RStudio\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/git_path.png\")\n```\n\n### Configure VSCode {#sec-vsc_config}\n\n>to develop\n\n### Register a GitHub account\n\nIf all you want to do is to keep track of files and file versions on your local computer then Git is sufficient.\nIf however, you would like to make an off-site copy of your project or make it available to your collaborators then you will need a web-based hosting service for your Git repositories.\nThis is where GitHub comes into play (there are also other services like [GitLab][gitlab], [Bitbucket][bitbucket] and [Savannah][savannah]).\nYou can sign up for a free account on GitHub [here][git_join].\nYou will need to specify a username, an email address and a strong password.\nWe suggest that you use your University email address (if you have one) as this will also allow you to apply for a free [educator or researcher account][git_edu] later on which gives you some useful [benefits][git-ben] (don't worry about this now though).\nWhen it comes to choosing a username we suggest you give this some thought.\nChoose a short(ish) rather than a long username, use all lowercase and hyphenate if you want to include multiple words, find a way of incorporating your actual name and lastly, choose a username that you will feel comfortable revealing to your future employer!  \n\nNext click on the 'Select a plan' (you may have to solve a simple puzzle first to verify you're human) and choose the 'Free Plan' option.\nGithub will send an email to the email address you supplied for you to verify.\n \n\nOnce you've completed all those steps you should have both Git and GitHub setup up ready for you to use (Finally!).\n\n## Setting up a project\n### in RStudio\n\nNow that you're all set up, let's create your first version controlled RStudio project.\nThere are a couple of different approaches you can use to do this.\nYou can either setup a remote GitHub repository first then connect an RStudio project to this repository (we'll call this Option 1).\nAnother option is to setup a local repository first and then link a remote GitHub repository to this repository (Option 2).\nYou can also connect an existing project to a GitHub repository but we won't cover this here.\nWe suggest that if you're completely new to Git and GitHub then use Option 1 as this approach sets up your local Git repository nicely and you can **push** and **pull** immediately.\nOption 2 requires a little more work and therefore there are more opportunities to go wrong.\nWe will cover both of these options below.\n\n### Option 1 - GitHub first {#sec-opt1}\n\nTo use the GitHub first approach you will first need to create a **repository (repo)** on GitHub.\nGo to your [GitHub page][github] and sign in if necessary.\nClick on the 'Repositories' tab at the top and then on the green 'New' button on the right \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-repo1\n#| fig-cap: Creating a new repository on Github\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_repo.png\")\n```\n\n\nGive your new repo a name (let's call it `first_repo` for this Chapter), select 'Public', tick on the 'Initialize this repository with a README' (this is important) and then click on 'Create repository' (ignore the other options for now).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-repo2\n#| fig-cap: Configuring a new repository on Github\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_repo_opt.png\")\n```\n\n\nYour new GitHub repository will now be created.\nNotice the README has been rendered in GitHub and is in markdown (.md) format (see @sec-rmarkdown_r on R markdown if this doesn't mean anything to you).\nNext click on the green 'Clone or Download' button and copy the `https//...` URL that pops up for later (either highlight it all and copy or click on the copy to clipboard icon to the right).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-repo3\n#| fig-cap: Getting the cloning path for a directory on github\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_repo_clone.png\")\n```\n\n\nOk, we now switch our attention to RStudio.\nIn RStudio click on the `File` -> `New Project` menu.\nIn the pop up window select `Version Control`.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj1\n#| fig-cap: Setting a new Github project in RStudio\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/proj_setup1.png\")\n```\n\n\nNow paste the the URL you previously copied from GitHub into the `Repository URL:` box.\nThis should then automatically fill out the `Project Directory Name:` section with the correct repository name (it's important that the name of this directory has the same name as the repository you created in GitHub).\nYou can then select where you want to create this directory by clicking on the `Browse` button opposite the `Create project as a subdirectory of:` option.\nNavigate to where you want the directory created and click OK.\nWe also tick the `Open in new session` option.\n\n<!-- no more labels below that line -->\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj2\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/proj_setup2.png\")\n```\n\n\nRStudio will now create a new directory with the same name as your repository on your local computer and will then **clone** your remote repository to this directory.\nThe directory will contain three new files; `first_repo.Rproj` (or whatever you called your repository), `README.md` and `.gitignore`.\nYou can check this out in the `Files` tab usually in the bottom right pane in RStudio.\nYou will also have a `Git` tab in the top right pane with two files listed (we will come to this later on in the Chapter).\nThat's it for Option 1, you now have a remote GitHub repository set up and this is linked to your local repository managed by RStudio.\nAny changes you make to files in this directory will be version controlled by Git.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj2a\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/proj_setup3.png\")\n```\n\n### Option 2 - RStudio first {#sec-opt2}\n\nAn alternative approach is to create a local RStudio project first and then link to a remote Github repository.\nAs we mentioned before, this option is more involved than Option 1 so feel free to skip this now and come back later to it if you're interested.\nThis option is also useful if you just want to create a local RStudio project linked to a local Git repository (i.e.\nno GitHub involved).\nIf you want to do this then just follow the instructions below omitting the GitHub bit.\n\n\nIn RStudio click on the `File` -> `New Project` menu and select the `New Directory` option.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj3\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS1.png\")\n```\n\n\nIn the pop up window select the `New Project` option\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj4\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/proj_setup_RS.png\")\n```\n\n\nIn the New Project window specify a `Directory name` (choose `second_repo` for this Chapter) and select where you would like to create this directory on you computer (click the `Browse` button).\nMake sure the `Create a git repository` option is ticked \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj5\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS2.png\")\n```\n\n\nThis will create a version controlled directory called `second_repo` on your computer that contains two files, `second_repo.Rproj` and `.gitignore` (there might also be a `.Rhistory` file but ignore this).\nYou can check this by looking in the `Files` tab in RStudio (usually in the bottom right pane).\n \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj6\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS3.png\")\n```\n\n\nOK, before we go on to create a repository on GitHub we need to do one more thing - we need to place our `second_repo.Rproj` and `.gitignore`files under version control.\nUnfortunately we haven't covered this in detail yet so just follow the next few instructions (blindly!) and we'll revisit them in @sec-use_git of this Chapter.\n \n\nTo get our two files under version control click on the 'Git' tab which is usually in the top tight pane in RStudio\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj7\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS4.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou can see that both files are listed.\nNext, tick the boxes under the 'Staged' column for both files and then click on the 'Commit' button.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj8\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS5.png\")\n```\n\n\nThis will take you to the 'Review Changes' window.\nType in the commit message 'First commit' in the 'Commit message' window and click on the 'Commit' button.\nA new window will appear with some messages which you can ignore for now.\nClick 'Close' to close this window and also close the 'Review Changes' window.\nThe two files should now have disappeared from the Git pane in RStudio indicating a successful commit.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj9\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS6.png\")\n```\n\n\nOK, that's those two files now under version control.\nNow we need to create a new repository on GitHub.\nIn your browser go to your [GitHub page][github] and sign in if necessary.\nClick on the 'Repositories' tab and then click on the green 'New' button on the right.\nGive your new repo the name `second_repo` (the same as your version controlled directory name) and select 'Public'.\nThis time **do not** tick the 'Initialize this repository with a README' (this is important) and then click on 'Create repository'.\n\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj10\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS7.png\")\n```\n\n\nThis will take you to a Quick setup page which provides you with some code for various situations.\nThe code we are interested in is the code under `...or push an existing repository from the command line` heading.\n \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj11\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS8.png\")\n```\n\n\nHighlight and copy the first line of code (note: yours will be slightly different as it will include your GitHub username not mine)  \n\n`git remote add origin https://github.com/alexd106/second_repo.git`  \n\nSwitch to RStudio, click on the 'Terminal' tab and paste the command into the Terminal.\nNow go back to GitHub and copy the second line of code  \n\n`git push -u origin master`  \n\nand paste this into the Terminal in RStudio.\nYou should see something like this\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj12\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_prog_RS9.png\")\n```\n\n\nIf you take a look at your repo back on GitHub (click on the `/second_repo` link at the top) you will see the `second_repo.Rproj` and `.gitignore` files have now been **pushed** to GitHub from your local repository.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj13\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS10.png\")\n```\n\n\nThe last thing we need to do is create and add a **README** file to your repository.\nA README file describes your project and is written using the same Markdown language you learned in @sec-rmarkdown_r.\nA good README file makes it easy for others (or the future you!) to use your code and reproduce your project.\nYou can create a README file in RStudio or in GitHub.\nLet's use the second option.\n \n\nIn your repository on GitHub click on the green `Add a README` button.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj14\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS11.png\")\n```\n\n\nNow write a short description of your project in the `<> Edit new file` section and then click on the green `Commit new file` button.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-new-proj15\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/new_proj_RS12.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou should now see the `README.md` file listed in your repository.\nIt won't actually exist on your computer yet as you will need to **pull** these changes back to your local repository, but more about that in the next section.\n \n\n\nWhether you followed Option 1 or Option 2 (or both) you have now successfully setup a version controlled RStudio project (and associated directory) and linked this to a GitHub repository.\nGit will now monitor this directory for any changes you make to files and also if you add or delete files.\nIf the steps above seem like a bit of an ordeal, just remember, you only need to do this once for each project and it gets much easier over time.\n\n### in VSCode\n\n> to develop\n\n## Using Git with RStudio {#sec-use_git}\n\nNow that we have our project and repositories (both local and remote) set up, it's finally time to learn how to use Git in your IDE!  \n\nTypically, when using Git your workflow will go something like this:   \n\n1.\nYou create/delete and edit files in your project directory on your computer as usual (saving these changes as you go)  \n\n2.\nOnce you've reached a natural 'break point' in your progress (i.e.\nyou'd be sad if you lost this progress) you **stage** these files\n\n3.\nYou then **commit** the changes you made to these staged files (along with a useful commit message) which creates a permanent snapshot of these changes  \n\n4.\nYou keep on with this cycle until you get to a point when you would like to **push** these changes to GitHub  \n\n5.\nIf you're working with other people on the same project you may also need to **pull** their changes to your local computer  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-workflow\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/workflow_3.png\")\n```\n\n\nOK, let's go through an example to help clarify this workflow.\n\n\nOpen up the `first_repo.Rproj` you created previously during Option 1.\nEither use the `File` -> `Open Project` menu or click on the top right project icon and select the appropriate project.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm0\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd0.png\")\n```\n\n\nCreate an R markdown document inside this project by clicking on the `File` -> `New File` -> `R markdown` menu (remember @sec-rmarkdown_r?).\n \n\nOnce created, we can delete all the example R markdown code (except the YAML header) as usual and write some interesting R markdown text and include a plot.\nWe'll use the inbuilt `cars` dataset to do this.\nSave this file (cmd + s for Mac or ctrl + s in Windows).\nYour R markdown document should look something like the following (it doesn't matter if it's not exactly the same).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm1\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd.png\")\n```\n\n\nTake a look at the 'Git' tab which should list your new R markdown document (`first_doc.Rmd` in this example) along with `first_repo.Rproj`, and `.gitignore` (you created these files previously when following Option 1).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm2\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd2.png\")\n```\n\n\nFollowing our workflow, we now need to **stage** these files.\nTo do this tick the boxes under the 'Staged' column for all files.\nNotice that there is a status icon next to the box which gives you an indication of how the files were changed.\nIn our case all of the files are to be added (capital A) as we have just created them.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm3\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 15%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/rstudio_git_cols.png\")\n```\n\n\nAfter you have staged the files the next step is to **commit** the files.\nThis is done by clicking on the 'Commit' button.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm4\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 50%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd3.png\")\n```\n\n\nAfter clicking on the 'Commit' button you will be taken to the 'Review Changes' window.\nYou should see the three files you staged from the previous step in the left pane.\nIf you click on the file name `first_doc.Rmd` you will see the changes you have made to this file highlighted in the bottom pane.\nAny content that you have added is highlighted in green and deleted content is highlighted in red.\nAs you have only just created this file, all the content is highlighted in green.\nTo commit these files (take a snapshot) first enter a mandatory commit message in the 'Commit message' box.\nThis message should be relatively short and informative (to you and your collaborators) and indicate why you made the changes, not what you changed.\nThis makes sense as Git keeps track of *what* has changed and so it is best not to use commit messages for this purpose.\nIt's traditional to enter the message 'First commit' (or 'Initial commit') when you commit files for the first time.\nNow click on the 'Commit' button to commit these changes.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm5\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd4.png\")\n```\n\n\nA summary of the commit you just performed will be shown.\nNow click on the 'Close' button to return to the 'Review Changes' window.\nNote that the staged files have now been removed.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm6\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd5.png\")\n```\n\n\nNow that you have committed your changes the next step is to **push** these changes to GitHub.\nBefore you push your changes it's good practice to first **pull** any changes from GitHub.\nThis is especially important if both you and your collaborators are working on the same files as it keeps you local copy up to date and avoids any potential conflicts.\nIn this case your repository will already be up to date but it's a good habit to get into.\nTo do this, click on the 'Pull' button on the top right of the 'Review Changes' window.\nOnce you have pulled any changes click on the green 'Push' button to push your changes.\nYou will see a summary of the push you just performed.\nHit the 'Close' button and then close the 'Review Changes' window.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm7\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd6.png\")\n```\n\n\nTo confirm the changes you made to the project have been pushed to GitHub, open your GitHub page, click on the Repositories link and then click on the  `first_repo` repository.\nYou should see four files listed including the `first_doc.Rmd` you just pushed.\nAlong side the file name you will see your last commit message ('First commit' in this case) and when you made the last commit.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm8\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd7.png\")\n```\n\n\nTo see the contents of the file click on the `first_doc.Rmd` file name.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rm9\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/first_Rmd8.png\")\n```\n\n### Tracking changes \n\nAfter following the steps outlined above, you will have successfully modified an RStudio project by creating a new R markdown document, staged and then committed these changes and finally pushed the changes to your GitHub repository.\nNow let's make some further changes to your R markdown file and follow the workflow once again but this time we 'll take a look at how to identify changes made to files, examine the commit history and how to restore to a previous version of the document.\n \n\nIn RStudio open up the `first_repo.Rproj` file you created previously (if not already open) then open the `first_doc.Rmd` file (click on the file name in the `Files` tab in RStudio).\n \n\nLet's make some changes to this document.\nDelete the line beginning with 'My first version controlled ...' and replace it with something more informative (see figure below).\nWe will also change the plotted symbols to red and give the plot axes labels.\nLastly, let's add a summary table of the dataframe using the `kable()` and `summary()` functions (you may need to install the `knitr` package if you haven't done so previously to use the `kable()` function) and finally render this document to pdf by changing the YAML option to `output: pdf_document`.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mod1\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/mod1.png\")\n```\n\n\nNow save these changes and then click the `knit` button to render to pdf.\nA new pdf file named `first_doc.pdf` will be created which you can view by clicking on the file name in the `Files` tab in RStudio.\n \n\nNotice that these two files have been added to the `Git` tab in RStudio.\nThe status icons indicate that the `first_doc.Rmd` file has been modified (capital M) and the `first_doc.pdf` file is currently untracked (question mark).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mod2\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/mod2.png\")\n```\n\n\nTo stage these files tick the 'Staged' box for each file and click on the 'Commit' button to take you to the 'Review Changes' window\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mod3\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/mod3.png\")\n```\n\n\nBefore you commit your changes notice the status of `first_doc.pdf` has changed from untracked to added (A).\nYou can view the changes you have made to the `first_doc.Rmd` by clicking on the file name in the top left pane which will provide you with a useful summary of the changes in the bottom pane (technically called diffs).\nLines that have been deleted are highlighted in red and lines that have been added are highlighted in green (note that from Git's point of view, a modification to a line is actually two operations: the removal of the original line followed by the creation of a new line).\nOnce you're happy, commit these changes by writing a suitable commit message and click on the 'Commit' button.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mod4\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/mod4.png\")\n```\n\n\nTo push the changes to GitHub, click on the 'Pull' button first (remember this is good practice even though you are only collaborating with yourself at the moment) and then click on the 'Push' button.\nGo to your online GitHub repository and you will see your new commits, including the `first_doc.pdf` file you created when you rendered your R markdown document.\n \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mod5\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/mod5.png\")\n```\n\n\nTo view the changes in `first_doc.Rmd` click on the file name for this file.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mod6\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/mod6.png\")\n```\n\n### Commit history \n\nOne of the great things about Git and GitHub is that you can view the history of all the commits you have made along with the associated commit messages.\nYou can do this locally using RStudio (or the Git command line) or if you have pushed your commits to GitHub you can check them out on the GitHub website.\n \n\nTo view your commit history in RStudio click on the 'History' button (the one that looks like a clock) in the Git pane to bring up the history view in the 'Review Changes' window.\nYou can also click on the 'Commit' or 'Diff' buttons which takes you to the same window (you just need to additionally click on the 'History' button in the 'Review Changes' window).\n \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-his1\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 60%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/c_history.png\")\n```\n\n\nThe history window is split into two parts.\nThe top pane lists every commit you have made in this repository (with associated commit messages) starting with the most recent one at the top and oldest at the bottom.\nYou can click on each of these commits and the bottom pane shows you the changes you have made along with a summary of the **Date** the commit was made, **Author** of the commit and the commit message (**Subject**).\nThere is also a unique identifier for the commit (**SHA** - Secure Hash Algorithm) and a **Parent** SHA which identifies the previous commit.\nThese SHA identifiers are really important as you can use them to view and revert to previous versions of files (details below @sec-undo).\nYou can also view the contents of each file by clicking on the 'View file @ SHA key` link (in our case 'View file @ 2b4693d1').\n \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-his2\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/c_history2.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou can also view your commit history on GitHub website but this will be limited to only those commits you have already pushed to GitHub.\nTo view the commit history navigate to the repository and click on the 'commits' link (in our case the link will be labelled '3 commits' as we have made 3 commits).\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-his3\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/c_history3.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou will see a list of all the commits you have made, along with commit messages, date of commit and the SHA identifier (these are the same SHA identifiers you saw in the RStudio history).\nYou can even browse the repository at a particular point in time by clicking on the `<>` link.\nTo view the changes in files associated with the commit simply click on the relevant commit link in the list.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-his4\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/c_history4.png\")\n```\n\n\nWhich will display changes using the usual format of green for additions and red for deletions.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-his5\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/c_history5.png\")\n```\n\n### Reverting changes {#sec-undo}\n\nOne the great things about using Git is that you are able to revert to previous versions of files if you've made a mistake, broke something or just prefer and earlier approach.\nHow you do this will depend on whether the changes you want to discard have been staged, committed or pushed to GitHub.\nWe'll go through some common scenarios below mostly using RStudio but occasionally we will need to resort to using the Terminal (still in RStudio though).\n \n\n#### Changes saved but not staged, committed or pushed {-}\n\nIf you have saved changes to your file(s) but not staged, committed or pushed these files to GitHub you can right click on the offending file in the Git pane and select 'Revert ...'.\nThis will roll back all of the changes you have made to the same state as your last commit.\nJust be aware that you cannot undo this operation so use with caution.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev1\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert1.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou can also undo changes to just part of a file by opening up the 'Diff' window (click on the 'Diff' button in the Git pane).\nSelect the line you wish to discard by double clicking on the line and then click on the 'Discard line' button.\nIn a similar fashion you can discard chunks of code by clicking on the 'Discard chunk' button.\n \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev2\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert2.png\")\n```\n\n#### Staged but not committed and not pushed {-}\n\nIf you have staged your files, but not committed them then simply unstage them by clicking on the 'Staged' check box in the Git pane (or in the 'Review Changes' window) to remove the tick.\nYou can then revert all or parts of the file as described in the section above.\n\n#### Staged and committed but not pushed {-}\n\nIf you have made a mistake or have forgotten to include a file in your last commit which you have not yet pushed to GitHub, you can just fix your mistake, save your changes, and then amend your previous commit.\nYou can do this by staging your file and then tick the 'Amend previous commit` box in the 'Review Changes' window before committing.\n  \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev3\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert3.png\")\n```\n\n\nIf we check out our commit history you can see that our latest commit contains both changes to the file rather than having two separate commits.\nWe use the amend commit approach alot but it's important to understand that you should **not** do this if you have already pushed your last commit to GitHub as you are effectively rewriting history and all sorts bad things may happen! \n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev4\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert4.png\")\n```\n\n\nIf you spot a mistake that has happened multiple commits back or you just want to revert to a previous version of a document you have a number of options.\n  \n\n**Option 1** - (probably the easiest but very unGit - but like, whatever!) is to look in your commit history in RStudio, find the commit that you would like to go back to and click on the 'View file @ ' button to show the file contents.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev5\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert5.png\")\n```\n\n\nYou can then copy the contents of the file to the clipboard and paste it into your current file to replace your duff code or text.\nAlternatively, you can click on the 'Save As' button and save the file with a different file name.\nOnce you have saved your new file you can delete your current unwanted file and then carry on working on your new file.\nDon't forget to stage and commit this new file.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev6\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert6.png\")\n```\n\n\n**Option 2** - (Git like) Go to your Git history, find the commit you would like to roll back to and write down (or copy) its SHA identifier.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev7\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert7.png\")\n```\n\n\nNow go to the Terminal in RStudio and type `git checkout <SHA> <filename>`.\nIn our case the SHA key is `2b4693d1` and the filename is `first_doc.Rmd` so our command would look like this:\n\n```\ngit checkout 2b4693d1 first_doc.Rmd\n```\n\nThe command above will copy the selected file version from the past and place it into the present.\nRStudio may ask you whether you want to reload the file as it now changed - select yes.\nYou will also need to stage and commit the file as usual.\n \n\nIf you want to revert all your files to the same state as a previous commit rather than just one file you can use (the single 'dot' `.` is important otherwise your HEAD will detach!):\n\n```\ngit rm -r .\ngit checkout 2b4693d1 .\n\n```\n\nNote that this will delete all files that you have created since you made this commit so be careful!\n\n#### Staged, committed and pushed {-}\n\nIf you have already pushed your commits to GitHub you can use the `git checkout` strategy described above and then commit and push to update GitHub (although this is not really considered 'best' practice).\nAnother approach would be to use `git revert` (Note: as far as we can tell `git revert` is not the same as the 'Revert' option in RStudio).\nThe `revert` command in Git essentially creates a new commit based on a previous commit and therefore preserves all of your commit history.\nTo rollback to a previous state (commit) you first need to identify the SHA for the commit you wish to go back to (as we did above) and then use the `revert` command in the Terminal.\nLet's say we want to revert back to our 'First commit' which has a SHA identifier `d27e79f1`.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev8\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert8.png\")\n```\n\n\nWe can use the `revert` command as shown below in the Terminal.\nThe `--no-commit` option is used to prevent us from having to deal with each intermediate commit.\n\n```\ngit revert --no-commit d27e79f1..HEAD\n```\n\nYour `first_doc.Rmd` file will now revert back to the same state as it was when you did your 'First commit'.\nNotice also that the `first_doc.pdf` file has been deleted as this wasn't present when we made our first commit.\nYou can now stage and commit these files with a new commit message and finally push them to GitHub.\nNotice that if we look at our commit history all of the commits we have made are still present.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev9\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert9.png\")\n```\n\n\nand our repo on GitHub also reflects these changes\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-rev10\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/revert10.png\")\n```\n\n## Using Git with VSCode {#sec-use_git_vsc}\n\nNow that we have our project and repositories (both local and remote) set up, it's finally time to learn how to use Git in VSCode!  \n\nTypically, when using Git your workflow will go something like this:   \n\n1.\nYou create/delete and edit files in your project directory on your computer as usual (saving these changes as you go)  \n\n2.\nOnce you've reached a natural 'break point' in your progress (i.e.\nyou'd be sad if you lost this progress) you **stage** these files\n\n3.\nYou then **commit** the changes you made to these staged files (along with a useful commit message) which creates a permanent snapshot of these changes  \n\n4.\nYou keep on with this cycle until you get to a point when you would like to **push** these changes to GitHub  \n\n5.\nIf you're working with other people on the same project you may also need to **pull** their changes to your local computer  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-workflow\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\n```\n\n\nOK, let's go through an example to help clarify this workflow.\n\n### Tracking changes {-}\n\n### Commit History {-}\n\n### Reverting changes {-}\n\n\n## Collaborate with Git {#sec-collab}\n\nGitHub is a great tool for collaboration, it can seem scary and complicated at first, but it is worth investing some time to learn how it works.\nWhat makes GitHub so good for collaboration is that it is a *distributed system*, which means that every collaborator works on their own copy of the project and changes are then merged together in the remote repository.\nThere are two main ways you can set up a collaborative project on GitHub.\nOne is the workflow we went through above, where everybody connects their local repository to the same remote one; this system works well with small projects where different people mainly work on different aspects of the project but can quickly become unwieldy if many people are collaborating and are working on the same files (merge misery!).\nThe second approach consists of every collaborator creating a copy (or **fork**) of the main repository, which becomes their remote repository.\nEvery collaborator then needs to send a request (a **pull request**) to the owner of the main repository to incorporate any changes into the main repository and this includes a review process before the changes are integrated.\nMore detail of these topics can be found in @sec-resources.\n\n## Git tips\n\nGenerally speaking you should commit often (including amended commits) but push much less often.\nThis makes collaboration easier and also makes the process of reverting to previous versions of documents much more straight forward.\nWe generally only push changes to GitHub when we're happy for our collaborators (or the rest of the world) to see our work.\nHowever, this is entirely up to you and depends on the project (and who you are working with) and what your priorities are when using Git.\n\n\nIf you don't want to track a file in your repository (maybe they are too large or transient files) you can get Git to ignore the file by adding it to the `.gitignore` file.\nOn RStudio, in the git pane,  you can right clicking on the filename to exclude and selecting 'Ignore...'\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-tip1\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| fig-align: center\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"images/github/tip1.png\")\n```\n\n\nThis will add the filename to the `.gitignore` file.\nIf you want to ignore multiple files or a particular type of file you can also include wildcards in the `.gitignore` file.\nFor example to ignore all `png` files you can include the expression `*.png` in your `.gitignore` file and save.\n\n\nIf it all goes pear shaped and you end up completely trashing your Git repository don't despair (we've all been there!).\nAs long as your GitHub repository is good, all you need to do is delete the offending project directory on your computer, create a new RStudio project and link this with your remote GitHub repository using Option 2 (-@sec-opt2).\nOnce you have cloned the remote repository you should be good to go.\n\n## Further resources {#sec-resources}\n\nThere are many good online guides to learn more about git and GitHub and as with any open source software there is a huge community that can be a great resource:\n\n- The British Ecological Society guide to [Reproducible Code][BES_code_guide]\n\n- The [GitHub guides][github_guides]\n\n- The Mozilla Science Lab [GitHub for Collaboration on Open Projects guide][mozilla]\n\n- Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub][git_happy].\nWe borrowed the idea (but with different content) of RStudio first, RStudio second in the 'Setting up a version controlled Project in RStudio' section.\n\n- Melanie Frazier's [GitHub: A beginner's guide to going back in time (aka fixing mistakes)][revert-git].\nWe followed this structure (with modifications and different content) in the 'Reverting changes' section.\n  \n\n- If you have done something terribly wrong and don't know how to fix it try [Oh Shit, Git][Oh_Shit_Git] or if you're easily offended [Dangit, Git][dang_it_git]\n\nThese are only a couple of examples, all you need to do is search for \"version control with git and GitHub\" to see how huge the community around these open source projects is and how many free resources are available for you to become a version control expert.\n\n```{r}\n#|
