Note that because the sample sizes are not the same for each group, this is an unbalanced design. Note also that there are missing data for some of the variables, meaning that not every measurement was made on every fish.\n\n### Fixed effects ANOVA (Model I)\n\n* Begin by having a look at the data by generating box plots of `rdwght` for `sex` and `location` from the file `Stu2wdat.csv` .\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\nStu2wdat <- read.csv(\"data/Stu2wdat.csv\")\n\nggplot(Stu2wdat, aes(x = sex, y = rdwght)) +\ngeom_boxplot(notch = TRUE) +\nfacet_grid(~location)\n```\n:::\n\nFrom this, it appears as though females might be larger at both locations. It’s difficult to get an idea of whether fish differ in size between the two locations. The presence of outliers on these plots suggests there might be problems meeting normality assumptions for the residuals.\n\n* Generate summary statistics for rdwght by sex and location .\n\n```{r}\nStu2wdat %>%\n  group_by(sex, location) %>%\n  summarise(\n    mean = mean(rdwght, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(rdwght, na.rm = TRUE), n = n()\n  )\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\n#| include: false\n#| #options with aggregate\nStu2wdat <- read.csv(\"data/Stu2wdat.csv\")\naggregate(rdwght ~ sex + location, data = Stu2wdat[!is.na(Stu2wdat$rdwght), ], FUN = \"summary\")\n```\n\n\nThe summary statistics confirm our interpretation of the box plots: females appear to be larger than males, and differences in fish size between locations are small.\n\n* Using the file `Stu2wdat.csv` , do a two-way factorial ANOVA:\n\n```{r}\n# Fit anova model and plot residual diagnostics\n# but first, save current par and set graphic page to hold 4 graphs\nopar <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nanova.model1 <- lm(rdwght ~ sex + location + sex:location,\n  contrasts = list(sex = contr.sum, location = contr.sum),\n  data = Stu2wdat\n)\nanova(anova.model1) \n```\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nBe careful here. R gives you the sequential sums of squares (Type I) and associated Mean squares and probabilities. These are not to be trusted unless the design is perfectly balanced. In this case, there are varying numbers of observations across sex and location combinations and therefore the design is not balanced.\n:::\n\nWhat you want are the partial sums of squares (type III). The easiest way to get them is to use the Anova() function in the `car` `r emoji::emoji(\"package\")` package (note the subtle difference, `Anova()` is not the same as `anova()`, remember case matters in R.). However, this is not enough by itself. To get the proper values for the type III sums of square, one also needs to specify contrasts, hence the cryptic  `contrasts = list(sex = contr.sum,location = contr.sum)`.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(car)\nAnova(anova.model1, type = 3)\n```\n\nOn the basis of the ANOVA, there is no reason to reject two null hypotheses: (1) that the effect of sex (if any) does not depend on location (no interaction), and (2) that there is no difference in the size of sturgeon (pooled over sex ) between the two locations . On the other hand, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in size between male and female sturgeon (pooled over location ), precisely as expected from the graphs.\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Checking model assumptions for ANOVA model1\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(anova.model1)\n```\n\nAs usual, we cannot accept the above results without first ensuring that the assumptions of ANOVA are met. Examination of the residuals plots above shows that the residuals are reasonably normally distributed, with the exception of three potential outliers flagged on the QQ plot (cases 101, 24, & 71; the latter two are on top of one another). However, Cook's distances are not large for these (the 0.5 contour is not even visible on the plot), so there is little indication that these are a concern.The residuals vs fit plot shows that the spread of residuals is about equal over the range of the fitted values, again with the exception of a few cases. When we test for normality of residuals we get:\n\n```{r}\nshapiro.test(residuals(anova.model1))\n```\n \nSo, there is evidence of non-normality in the residuals.\n\nWe will use the Levene’s test to examine the assumption of homogeneity of variances, just as we did with the 1-way anova.\n\n```{r}\nleveneTest(rdwght ~ sex * location, data = Stu2wdat)\n```\n\nIf the assumption of homogeneity of variances was valid, we would be accepting the null that the mean of the absolute values of residuals does not vary among levels of sex and location (i.e., group ). The above table shows that the hypothesis is rejected and we conclude there is evidence of heteroscedascticity. All in all, there is some evidence that several important assumptions have been violated. However, whether these violations are sufficiently large to invalidate our conclusions remains to be seen.\n\n::: {.callout-caution}\n# Exercise\nRepeat this procedure using the data file Stu2mdat.Rdata . Now what do you conclude? Suppose you wanted to compare the sizes of males and females: in what way would these comparisons differ between Stu2wdat.Rdata and Stu2mdat.Rdata ?\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\n#| results: hide\nStu2mdat <- read.csv(\"data/Stu2mdat.csv\")\nanova.model2 <- lm(\n  formula = rdwght ~ sex + location + sex:location,\n  contrasts = list(sex = contr.sum, location = contr.sum),\n  data = Stu2mdat\n)\nsummary(anova.model2)\nAnova(anova.model2, type = 3)\n```\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nsummary(anova.model2)\n```\n\nNote that in this case, we see that at Cumberland House, females are larger than males, whereas the opposite is true in The Pas (you can confirm this observation by generating summary statistics). What happens with the ANOVA (remember, you want Type III sum of squares)?\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nAnova(anova.model2, type = 3)\n```\n\nIn this case, the interaction term `sex:location` is significant but the main effects are not significant.\n\n* You might find it useful here to generate plots for the two data files to compare the interactions between `sex` and `location`. The effect plot shows the relationship between means for each combination of factors (also called cell means). Generate an effect plot for the two models using the `allEffects()` command from the `effects` `r emoji::emoji(\"package\")` package:\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Effet du sexe et du lieu sur le poids des esturgeons\nlibrary(effects)\nallEffects(anova.model1)\nplot(allEffects(anova.model1), \"sex:location\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Effet du sexe et du lieu sur le poids des esturgeons\nallEffects(anova.model2)\nplot(allEffects(anova.model2), \"sex:location\")\n```\n\nThere is a very large difference between the results from `Stu2wdat` and `Stu2mdat`. In the former case, because there is no significant interaction, we can essentially pool over the levels of factor 1 (`sex`, say) to test for the effects of location , or over the levels of factor 2 (`location`) to test for the effects of sex . In fact, if we do so and simply run a one-way ANOVA on the `Stu2wdat` data with sex as the grouping variable, we get:\n\n```{r}\nAnova(aov(rdwght ~ sex, data = Stu2wdat), type = 3)\n```\n\nNote that here the residual sum of squares (17583) is only slightly higher than for the 2-way model (17530), simply because, in the 2-way model, only a small fraction of the explained sums of squares is due to the location main effect or the sex:LOCATION interaction. On the other hand, if you try the same trick with `stu2mdat`, you get:\n\n<!-- need to add r code to grad the value of SS in text -->\n```{r}\nAnova(aov(rdwght ~ sex, data = Stu2mdat), type = 3)\n```\n\nHere, the residuals sum of squares (19309) is much larger than in the 2-way model (17530), because most of the explained sums of squares is due to the interaction. Note that if we did this, we would conclude that male and female sturgeons don't differ in size. But in fact they do: it's just that the difference is in different directions, depending on location. This is why it is always dangerous to try and make too much of main effects in the presence of interactions!\n\n### Mixed effects ANOVA (Model III)\n\nWe have neglected an important component in the above analyses, and that is related to the type of ANOVA model we wish to run. In this example, Location could be considered a random effect, whereas sex is a fixed effect (because it is \"fixed\" biologically), and so this model could be treated as a mixed model (Model III) ANOVA. Note that in these analyses, R treats analyses by default as Model I ANOVA, so that the main effects and the interaction are tested over the residuals mean square. Recall, however, that in a Model III ANOVA, main effects are tested over the interaction mean square or the pooled interaction mean square and residual mean square (depending on which statistician you consult!)\n\n* Working with the `Stu2wdat` data, rebuild the ANOVA table for `rdwght`\nfor the situation in which `location` is a random factor and `sex` is a\nfixed factor. To do this, you need to recalculate the F-ratio for sex using the `sex:location` interaction mean square instead of the residual mean square. This is most easily accomplished by hand, making sure you are working with the Type III Sums of squares ANOVA table.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nAnova(anova.model1, type = 3)\n```\n:::\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nAnova(anova.model1, type = 3)\n```\n\nFor `sex`, the new ratio of mean squares is\n\n$$F = \\frac{(1745/1)}{(49/1)} = 35.6$$\n\nTo assign a probability to the new `F-value`, enter the following in the commands window: `pf(F, df1, df2, lower.tail = FALSE)` , where `F` is the newly calculated `F-value`, and `df1` and `df2` are the degrees of freedom of the numerator (`sex`) and denominator (`SEX:location`), respectively.\n\n```{r}\npf(35.6, 1, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n```\n\nNote that the *p value* for `sex` is now non-significant. This is because the error MS of the initial ANOVA is smaller than the interaction MS, but mostly because the number of degrees of freedom of the denominator of the F test has dropped from 178 to 1. In general, a drop in the denominator degrees of freedom makes it much more difficult to reach significance.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nMixed model which are a generalisation of mixed-effect ANOVA are now really developped and are to be favoured intead of doing it by hand.\n:::\n\n## 2-way factorial ANOVA without replication\n\nIn some experimental designs, there are no replicates within data cells: perhaps it is simply too expensive to obtain more than one datum per cell. A 2-way ANOVA is still possible under these circumstances, but there is an important limitation.\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nBecause there is no replication within cells, there is no error variance: we have simply a row sum of squares, a column sum of squares, and a remainder sum of squares. This has important implications: if there is an interaction in a Model III ANOVA, only the fixed effect can be tested (over the remainder MS); for Model I ANOVAs, or for random effects in Model III ANOVAs, it is not appropriate to test main effects over the remainder unless we are sure there is no interaction.\n:::\n\nA limnologist studying Round Lake in Algonquin Park takes a single temperature ( `temp` ) reading at 10 different depths ( `depth` , in m) at four times ( date) over the course of the summer. Her data are shown in `Nr2wdat.csv`.\n\n* Do a two-way unreplicated ANOVA using temp as the dependent vari able, date and depth as the factor variables (you will need to recode depth to tell R to treat this variable as a factor). Note that there is no interaction term included in this model.\n\n```{r}\nnr2wdat <- read.csv(\"data/nr2wdat.csv\")\nnr2wdat$depth <- as.factor(nr2wdat$depth)\nanova.model4 <- lm(temp ~ date + depth, data = nr2wdat)\nAnova(anova.model4, type = 3)\n```\n\nAssuming that this is a Model III ANOVA ( `date` random, `depth` fixed), what do you conclude? (Hint: you may want to generate an interaction plot of temp versus depth and month, just to see what's going on.)\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Effet du mois et de la profondeur sur la température\ninteraction.plot(nr2wdat$depth, nr2wdat$date, nr2wdat$temp)\n```\n\nThere is a highly significant decrease in temperature as depth increases. To test the effect of month (the (assumed) random factor), we must assume that there is no interaction between depth and month, i.e. that the change in temperature with depth is the same for each month. This is a dubious assumption: if you plot temperature against depth for each month, you should see that the temperature profile becomes increasingly non-linear as the summer progresses (i.e. the thermocline develops), from almost a linear decline in early spring to what amounts to a step decline in August. In other words, the relationship between temperature and depth does change with month, so that if you were to use the above fitted model to estimate, say, the temperature at a depth of 5 m in July, you would not get a particularly good estimate.\n\nIn terms of residual diagnostics, have a look at the residuals probability plot and residuals vs fitted values plot.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| error: true\n#| fig-cap: Conditions d'applications du modèle anova.model4\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(anova.model4)\n```\n\n```{r}\nshapiro.test(residuals(anova.model4))\n```\n\nTesting the residuals for normality, we get `p = 0.16`, so that the normality assumption seems to be O.K. In terms of heteroscedasticity, we can only test among months, using depths as replicates (or among depths using months as replicates). Using depths as replicates within months, we find\n\n```{r}\nleveneTest(temp ~ date, data = nr2wdat)\n```\n\nSo there seems to be some problem here, as can be plainly seen in the above plot of residuals vs fit. All in all, this analysis is not very satisfactory: there appears to be some problems with the assumptions, and the assumption of no interaction between depth and date would appear to be invalid.\n\n\n## Nested designs\n\nA common experimental design occurs when each major group (or treatment) is divided into randomly chosen subgroups. For example, a geneticist interested in the effects of genotype on desiccation resistance in fruit flies might conduct an experiment with larvae of three different genotypes. For each genotype (major group), she sets up three environmental chambers (sub-groups, replicates within groups) with a fixed temperature humidity regime, and in each chamber, she has five larvae for which she records the number of hours each larvae survived.\n\n- The file `Nestdat.csv` contains the results of just such an experi ment. The file lists three variables: genotype , chamber and survival . Run a nested ANOVA with survival as the dependent variable, genotype/chamber as the independent variables (this is the shorthand notation for a chamber effect nested under genotype).\n\n```{r}\nnestdat <- read.csv(\"data/nestdat.csv\")\nnestdat$chamber <- as.factor(nestdat$chamber)\nnestdat$genotype <- as.factor(nestdat$genotype)\nanova.nested <- lm(survival ~ genotype / chamber, data = nestdat)\n```\n\nWhat do you conclude from this analysis? What analysis would (should) you do next? (Hint: if there is a non-significant effect of chambers within genotypes, then you can increase the power of between-genotype comparisons by pooling over chambers within genotypes, although not everyone (Dr. Rundle included) agrees with such pooling.) Do it! Make sure you check your assumptions!\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Conditions d'applications du modèle anova.nested\nanova(anova.nested)\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(anova.nested)\n```\n:::\n\nWe conclude from this analysis that there is no (significant) variation among chambers within genotypes, but that the null hypothesis that all genotypes have the same dessiccation resistance (as measured by survival) is rejected (Test of genotype using MS genotype:chamber as denominator: F = 1476.11/6.78 = 217.7153, P<0.0001). In other words, genotypes differ in their survival.\n\nSince the chambers within genotypes effect is non-significant, we may want to pool over chambers to increase our degrees of freedom:\n\n```{r}\nanova.simple <- lm(survival ~ genotype, data = nestdat)\nanova(anova.simple)\n```\n\nThus, we conclude that there is significant variation among the three genotypes in dessiccation resistance.\n\nA box plot of survival across genotypes shows clearly that there is significant variation among the three genotypes in dessiccation resistance. This can be combined with a formal Tukey multiple comparison test:\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: 'Effet du genotype sur la résistance à la dessication avec un test de Tukey '\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\n# Compute and plot means and Tukey CI\nmeans <- glht(anova.simple, linfct = mcp(\n  genotype =\n    \"Tukey\"\n))\ncimeans <- cld(means)\n# use sufficiently large upper margin\nold.par <- par(mai = c(1, 1, 1.25, 1))\n# plot\nplot(cimeans, las = 1) # las option to put y-axis labels as God intended them\n```\n\nSo, we conclude from the Tukey analysis and plot that dessiccation resistance (R) , as measured by larval survival under hot, dry conditions, varies significantly among all three genotypes with R(AA) > R(Aa) > R(aa).\n\nBefore concluding this, however, we must test the assumptions. Here are the residual plots and diagnostics for the one-way (unnested) design:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Conditions d'applications du modèle anova.simple\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(anova.simple)\n```\n:::\n\nSo, all the assumptions appear to be valid, and the conclusion reached above still holds. Note that if you compare the residual mean squares of the nested and one-way ANOVAs (5.04 vs 5.29), they are almost identical. This is not surprising, given the small contribution of the chamber %in% genotype effect to the explained sum of squares.\n\n\n## Two-way non-parametric ANOVA\n\nTwo-way non-parametric ANOVA is an extension of the non-parametric one-way methods discussed previously. The basic procedure is to rank all the data in the sample from smallest to largest, then carry out a 2-way ANOVA on the ranks. This can be done either for replicated or unreplicated data.\n\nUsing the data file `Stu2wdat.csv` , do a two-factor ANOVA to examine the effects of `sex` and `location` on `rank(rdwght)`.\n\n```{r}\naov.rank <- aov(\n  rank(rdwght) ~ sex * location,\n  contrasts = list(\n    sex = contr.sum, location = contr.sum\n  ),\n  data = Stu2wdat\n)\n```\n\nThe Scheirer-Ray-Hare extension of the Kruskall-Wallis test is done by computing a statistic H given by the effect sums of squares (SS) divided by the total MS. The latter can be calculated as the variance of the ranks. We compute an H statistic for each term. The H-statistics are then compared to a theoretical $\\chi^2$ (chi-square) distribution using the command line: `pchisq(H, df, lower.tail = FALSE)` , where `H` and `df` are the calculated H-statistics and associated degrees of freedom, respectively. \n\n- Use the ANOVA table based on ranks to test the effects of `sex` and on `rdwght`. What do you conclude? How does this result compare with the result obtained with the parametric 2-way ANOVA done before?\n\n```{r}\nAnova(aov.rank, type = 3)\n```\n\nTo calculate the Scheirer-Ray-Hare extension to the Kruskall-Wallis test, you must first calculate the total mean square (MS), i.e. the variance of the ranked data. In this case, there are 186 observations, their ranks are therefore the series 1, 2, 3, ..., 186. The variance can be calculated simply as var(1:186) (Isn’t R neat? Cryptic maybe, but neat). So we can compute the `H` statistic for each term:\n\n```{r}\nHsex <- 58394 / var(1:186)\nHlocation <- 1128 / var(1:186)\nHsexloc <- 1230 / var(1:186)\n```\n\nAnd convert these statistics into p-values:\n\n```{r}\n# sex\nHsex\npchisq(Hsex, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n# location\nHlocation\npchisq(Hlocation, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n\n# sex:location\nHsexloc\npchisq(Hsexloc, 1, lower.tail = FALSE)\n```\n\nNote that these results are the same as those obtained in our original two-way parametric ANOVA. Despite the reduced power, we still find significant differences between the sexes, but still no interaction and no effect due to location.\n\nThere is, however, an important difference. Recall that in the original parametric ANOVA, there was a significant effect of sex when we considered the problem as a Model I ANOVA. However, if we consider it as Model III, the significant sex effect could in principle disappear, because the df associated with the interaction MS are much smaller than the df associated with the Model I error MS. In this case, however, the interaction MS is about half that of the error MS. So, the significant sex effect becomes even more significant if we analyze the problem as a Model III ANOVA. Once again, we see the importance of specifying the appropriate ANOVA design.\n\n## Multiple comparisons\n\nFurther hypothesis testing in multiway ANOVAs depends critically on the outcome of the initial ANOVA. If you are interested in comparing groups of marginal means (that is, means of treatments for one factor pooled over levels of the other factor, e.g., between male and female sturgeon pooled over location), this can be done exactly as outlined for multiple comparisons for one-way ANOVAs. For comparison of individual cell means, you must specify the interaction as the group variable.\n\nThe file `wmcdat2.csv` shows measured oxygen consumption ( `o2cons` ) of two species ( `species` = A, B)) of limpets at three different concentrations of seawater ( `conc` = 100, 75, 50%) taken from Sokal and Rohlf, 1995, p. 332.\n\n- Run a 2-way factorial ANOVA on `wmcdat2` data, using `o2cons` as the dependent variable and species and conc as the factors. What do you conclude?\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\n#| results: hide\nwmcdat2 <- read.csv(\"data/wmcdat2.csv\")\nwmcdat2$species <- as.factor(wmcdat2$species)\nwmcdat2$conc <- as.factor(wmcdat2$conc)\nanova.model5 <- lm(o2cons ~ species * conc, data = wmcdat2)\nAnova(anova.model5, type = 3)\n```\n:::\n\nThe ANOVA table is shown below. Technically, because the sample sizes in individual cells are rather small, this analysis should be repeated using a non-parametric ANOVA. For the moment, let’s stick with the parametric analysis.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nAnova(anova.model5, type = 3)\n```\n\n\nLook at the diagnostic plots:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(anova.model5)\n```\n:::\n\nHomoscedasticity looks ok, but normality less so.. Testing for\nnormality, we get:\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\nshapiro.test(residuals(anova.model5))\n```\n:::\n\nSo there is evidence of non-normality, but otherwise everything looks O.K. Since the ANOVA is relatively robust with respect to non-normality, we proceed, but if we wanted to reassure ourselves, we could run a non-parametric ANOVA, and get the same answer.\n\n- On the basis of the ANOVA results obtained above, which means would you proceed to compare? Why?\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\nNeed to add an explnation here\n:::\n\n\nOverall, we conclude that there are no differences among species, and that the effect of concentration does not depend on species (no interaction). Since there is no interaction and no main effect due to species, the only comparison of interest is among salinity concentrations:\n\n```{r}\n#| fig-cap: Comparaison de Tukey des moyennes de consommation d'oxygèn en fonction del\n#|   la concentration\n# fit simplified model\nanova.model6 <- aov(o2cons ~ conc, data = wmcdat2)\n# Make Tukey multiple comparisons\nTukeyHSD(anova.model6)\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 1))\n# Graph of all comparisons for conc\ntuk <- glht(anova.model6, linfct = mcp(conc = \"Tukey\"))\n# extract information\ntuk.cld <- cld(tuk)\n# use sufficiently large upper margin\nold.par <- par(mai = c(1, 1, 1.25, 1))\n# plot\nplot(tuk.cld)\npar(old.par)\n```\n\nSo there is evidence of a significant difference in oxygen consumption at a reduction in salinity to 50% of regular seawater, but not at a reduction of only 25%.\n\n- Repeat the analysis described above using `wmc2dat2.csv` . How do\nyour results compare with those obtained for `wmcdat2.csv` ?\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Solution\n\n```{r}\nwmc2dat2 <- read.csv(\"data/wmc2dat2.csv\")\nwmc2dat2$species <- as.factor(wmc2dat2$species)\nwmc2dat2$conc <- as.factor(wmc2dat2$conc)\nanova.model7 <- lm(o2cons ~ species * conc, data = wmc2dat2)\n```\n:::\n\nUsing `wmc2dat2.csv`,we get:\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nAnova(anova.model7, type = 3)\n```\n\nHere there is a large interaction effect, and consequently, there is no\npoint in comparing marginal means. This is made clear by examining\nan interaction plot:\n\n```{r}\nwith(wmc2dat2, interaction.plot(conc, species, o2cons))\n```\n\n- Working still with the `wmc2dat2` data set, compare individual cell means (6 in all), with the Bonferonni adjustment. To do this, it is helpful to create a new variable to indicate all the combinations of `species` and `conc`:\n\n```{r}\nwmc2dat2$species.conc <- as.factor(paste0(wmc2dat2$species, wmc2dat2$conc))\n```\n\nThen we can conduct pairwise bonferroni comparisons:\n\n```{r}\nwith(wmc2dat2, pairwise.t.test(o2cons, species.conc, p.adj = \"bonf\"))\n```\n\nThese comparisons are a little more difficult to interpret, but the analysis essentially examines for differences among seawater concentrations within species A and for differences among concentrations within species B. We see here that the o2Cons at 50% seawater for species B is significantly different from that of 75% and 100% seawater for species B, whereas there are no significant differences in `o2cons` for species A across all seawater concentrations.\n\nI find these outputs rather unsatisfying because they show only p-values, but no indication of effect size. One can get both the conclusion from the multiple comparison procedure and an indication of effect size from the graph produced with the following code:\n\n```{r}\n# fit one-way anova comparing all combinations of species.conc combinations\nanova.modelx <- aov(o2cons ~ species.conc, data = wmc2dat2)\ntuk2 <- glht(anova.modelx, linfct = mcp(species.conc = \"Tukey\"))\n# extract information\ntuk2.cld <- cld(tuk2)\n# use sufficiently large upper margin\nold.par <- par(mai = c(1, 1, 1.25, 1))\n# plot\nplot(tuk2.cld)\npar(old.par)\n```\n\nNote that in this analysis, we have used the error MS = 9.474 from the original model to contrast cell means. Recall, however, that this assumes that in fact we are dealing with a Model I ANOVA, which may or may not be the case ( conc is certainly a fixed factor, but species might be either fixed or random).\n\n\n## Test de permutation pour l’ANOVA à deux facteurs de classification\n\nWhen data do not meet the assumptions of the parametric analysis in two- and multiway ANOVA, as an alternative to the non-parametric ANOVA, it is possible to run permutation tests to calculate p-values. The lmPerm package does this easily.\n\n\n```{r}\n#| label: ano-perm2\n#| eval: false\n#######################################################################\n## lmPerm version of permutation test\nlibrary(lmPerm)\n# for generality, copy desired dataframe to mydata\n# and model formula to myformula\nmydata <- Stu2wdat\nmyformula <- as.formula(\"rdwght ~ sex+location+sex:location\")\n# Fit desired model on the desired dataframe\nmymodel <- lm(myformula, data = mydata)\n# Calculate permutation p-value\nanova(lmp(myformula, data = mydata, perm = \"Prob\", center = FALSE, Ca = 0.001))\n```\n\n\n`lmPerm` was orphaned for a while and the code below, while clunkier, provided an alternative way of doing it. You would have to adapt it for other situations.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: ano-perm\n#| eval: false\n###########################################################\n# Permutation test for two way ANOVA\n# Ter Braak creates residuals from cell means and then permutes across\n# all cells\n# This can be accomplished by taking residuals from the full model\n# modified from code written by David C.
