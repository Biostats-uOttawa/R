This will help build and maintain all important momentum.\nLearning R is not a memory test. One of the beauties of a scripting language is that you will always have your code to refer back to when you inevitably forget how to do something.\nYou don’t need to know everything there is to know about R to use it productively. If you get stuck, Google it, it’s not cheating and writing a good search query is a skill in itself. Just make sure you check thoroughly that the code you find is doing what you want it to do.\nIf you find yourself staring at code for hours trying to figure out why it’s not working then walk away for a few minutes. We’ve lost count of the number of times we were able to spot our mistake almost immediately after returning from a short caffeine break.\nIn R there are many ways to tackle a particular problem. If your code doesn’t look like someone elses, but it does what you want it to do in a reasonable time and robustly then don’t worry about it - job done.\nRelated to our previous point, remember R is just a tool to help you answer your interesting questions. Although it can be fun to immerse yourself in all things R (we often do), don’t lose sight of what’s important - your research question(s) and your data. No amount of skill using R will help if your data collection is fundamentally flawed or your question vague.\nRecognize that there will be times when things will get a little tough or frustrating. Try to accept these periods as part of the natural process of learning a new skill (we’ve all been there) and remember, the time and energy you invest now will be more than payed back in the not too distant future.\n\nGood luck and don’t forget to have fun.",

    "section": "\n1.2 Installing an IDE",
    "text": "1.2 Installing an IDE\nWe strongly recommend to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software to work with R. One simple and extremely popular IDE is RStudio. An alternative to RStudio is Visual Studio Code, or VSCode. An IDE can be thought of as an add-on to R which provides a more user-friendly interface, incorporating the R Console, a script editor and other useful functionality (like R markdown and Git Hub integration).\n\n1.2.1 RStudio\nRStudio is freely available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems and can be downloaded from the RStudio site. You should select the ‘RStudio Desktop’ version. Note: you must install R before you install RStudio (see previous section for details).\n \n\n1.2.2 VSCode\nVSCode is freely available for Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems and can be downloaded from the VS Code site. Note: you must install R before you install RStudio (see previous section for details). In addition you need to install the R extension to VSCode.\n \n\n1.2.3 Alternatives to RStudio and VSCode\nRather than using an ‘all in one’ IDE many people choose to use R and a separate script editor to write and execute R code. If you’re not familiar with what a script editor is, you can think of it as a bit like a word processor but specifically designed for writing code. Happily, there are many script editors freely available so feel free to download and experiment until you find one you like. Some script editors are only available for certain operating systems and not all are specific to R. Suggestions for script editors are provided below. Which one you choose is up to you: one of the great things about R is that YOU get to choose how you want to use R. #### Advanced text editors A light yet efficient way to work with R is using advanced text editors such as:\n\n\nAtom (all operating systems)\n\nBBedit (Mac OS)\n\ngedit (Linux; comes with most Linux distributions)\n\nMacVim (Mac OS)\n\nNano (Linux)\n\nNotepad++ (Windows)\n\nSublime Text (all operating systems)\n\nvim and its extension NVim-R (Linux)\n\n\n1.2.3.1 Integrated development environments\nThese environments are more powerful than simple text editors, and are similar to RStudio:\n\n\nEmacs and its extension Emacs Speaks Statistics (all operating systems)\n\nRKWard (Linux)\n\nTinn-R (Windows)",

    "section": "\n1.3 IDE orientation",
    "text": "1.3 IDE orientation\n\n1.3.1 RStudio\nWhen you open R studio for the first time you should see the following layout (it might look slightly different on a Windows computer).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe large window (aka pane) on the left is the Console window. The window on the top right is the Environment / History / Connections pane and the bottom right window is the Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer window. We will discuss each of these panes in turn below. You can customise the location of each pane by clicking on the ‘Tools’ menu then selecting Global Options –&gt; Pane Layout. You can resize the panes by clicking and dragging the middle of the window borders in the direction you want. There are a plethora of other ways to customise RStudio.\n \n\n1.3.1.1 Console\nThe Console is the workhorse of R. This is where R evaluates all the code you write. You can type R code directly into the Console at the command line prompt, &gt;. For example, if you type 2 + 2 into the Console you should obtain the answer 4 (reassuringly). Don’t worry about the [1] at the start of the line for now.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHowever, once you start writing more R code this becomes rather cumbersome. Instead of typing R code directly into the Console a better approach is to create an R script. An R script is just a plain text file with a .R file extension which contains your lines of R code. These lines of code are then sourced into the R Console line by line. To create a new R script click on the ‘File’ menu then select New File –&gt; R Script.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNotice that you have a new window (called the Source pane) in the top left of RStudio and the Console is now in the bottom left position. The new window is a script editor and where you will write your code.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo source your code from your script editor to the Console simply place your cursor on the line of code and then click on the ‘Run’ button in the top right of the script editor pane.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou should see the result in the Console window. If clicking on the ‘Run’ button starts to become tiresome you can use the keyboard shortcut ‘ctrl + enter’ (on Windows and Linux) or ‘cmd + enter’ (on Mac). You can save your R scripts as a .R file by selecting the ‘File’ menu and clicking on save. Notice that the file name in the tab will turn red to remind you that you have unsaved changes. To open your R script in RStudio select the ‘File’ menu and then ‘Open File…’. Finally, its worth noting that although R scripts are saved with a .R extension they are actually just plain text files which can be opened with any text editor.\n\n1.3.1.2 Environment/History/Connections\nThe Environment / History / Connections window shows you lots of useful information. You can access each component by clicking on the appropriate tab in the pane.\n\nThe ‘Environment’ tab displays all the objects you have created in the current (global) environment. These objects can be things like data you have imported or functions you have written. Objects can be displayed as a List or in Grid format by selecting your choice from the drop down button on the top right of the window. If you’re in the Grid format you can remove objects from the environment by placing a tick in the empty box next to the object name and then click on the broom icon. There’s also an ‘Import Dataset’ button which will import data saved in a variety of file formats. However, we would suggest that you don’t use this approach to import your data as it’s not reproducible and therefore not robust (see Chapter 3 for more details).\nThe ‘History’ tab contains a list of all the commands you have entered into the R Console. You can search back through your history for the line of code you have forgotten, send selected code back to the Console or Source window. We usually never use this as we always refer back to our R script.\nThe ‘Connections’ tab allows you to connect to various data sources such as external databases.\n\n1.3.1.3 Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer\n\nThe ‘Files’ tab lists all external files and directories in the current working directory on your computer. It works like file explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac). You can open, copy, rename, move and delete files listed in the window.\nThe ‘Plots’ tab is where all the plots you create in R are displayed (unless you tell R otherwise). You can ‘zoom’ into the plots to make them larger using the magnifying glass button, and scroll back through previously created plots using the arrow buttons. There is also the option of exporting plots to an external file using the ‘Export’ drop down menu. Plots can be exported in various file formats such as jpeg, png, pdf, tiff or copied to the clipboard (although you are probably better off using the appropriate R functions to do this - see Chapter 4 for more details).\nThe ‘Packages’ tab lists all of the packages that you have installed on your computer. You can also install new packages and update existing packages by clicking on the ‘Install’ and ‘Update’ buttons respectively.\nThe ‘Help’ tab displays the R help documentation for any function. We will go over how to view the help files and how to search for help in Chapter 2.\nThe ‘Viewer’ tab displays local web content such as web graphics generated by some packages.",

    "section": "\n1.4 R packages",
    "text": "1.4 R packages\nThe base installation of R comes with many useful packages as standard. These packages will contain many of the functions you will use on a daily basis. However, as you start using R for more diverse projects (and as your own use of R evolves) you will find that there comes a time when you will need to extend R’s capabilities. Happily, many thousands of R users have developed useful code and shared this code as installable packages. You can think of a package as a collection of functions, data and help files collated into a well defined standard structure which you can download and install in R. These packages can be downloaded from a variety of sources but the most popular are CRAN, Bioconductor and GitHub. Currently, CRAN hosts over 15000 packages and is the official repository for user contributed R packages. Bioconductor provides open source software oriented towards bioinformatics and hosts over 1800 R packages. GitHub is a website that hosts git repositories for all sorts of software and projects (not just R). Often, cutting edge development versions of R packages are hosted on GitHub so if you need all the new bells and whistles then this may be an option. However, a potential downside of using the development version of an R package is that it might not be as stable as the version hosted on CRAN (it’s in development!) and updating packages won’t be automatic.\n\n1.4.1 CRAN packages\nTo install a package from CRAN you can use the install.packages() function. For example if you want to install the remotes package enter the following code into the Console window of RStudio (note: you will need a working internet connection to do this)\n\ninstall.packages('remotes', dependencies = TRUE)\n\nYou may be asked to select a CRAN mirror, just select ‘0-cloud’ or a mirror near to your location. The dependencies = TRUE argument ensures that additional packages that are required will also be installed.\nIt’s good practice to occasionally update your previously installed packages to get access to new functionality and bug fixes. To update CRAN packages you can use the update.packages() function (you will need a working internet connection for this)\n\nupdate.packages(ask = FALSE)\n\nThe ask = FALSE argument avoids having to confirm every package download which can be a pain if you have many packages installed.\n\n1.4.2 Bioconductor packages\nTo install packages from Bioconductor the process is a little different. You first need to install the BiocManager package. You only need to do this once unless you subsequently reinstall or upgrade R\n\ninstall.packages('BiocManager', dependencies = TRUE)\n\nOnce the BiocManager package has been installed you can either install all of the ‘core’ Bioconductor packages with\n\nBiocManager::install()\n\nor install specific packages such as the ‘GenomicRanges’ and ‘edgeR’ packages\n\nBiocManager::install(c(\"GenomicRanges\", \"edgeR\"))\n\nTo update Bioconductor packages just use the BiocManager::install() function again\n\nBiocManager::install(ask = FALSE)\n\nAgain, you can use the ask = FALSE argument to avoid having to confirm every package download.\n\n1.4.3 GitHub packages\nThere are multiple options for installing packages hosted on GitHub. Perhaps the most efficient method is to use the install_github() function from the remotes package (you installed this package previously). Before you use the function you will need to know the GitHub username of the repository owner and also the name of the repository. For example, the development version of dplyr from Hadley Wickham is hosted on the tidyverse GitHub account and has the repository name ‘dplyr’ (just Google ‘github dplyr’). To install this version from GitHub use\n\nremotes::install_github('tidyverse/dplyr')\n\nThe safest way (that we know of) to update a package installed from GitHub is to just reinstall it using the above command.\n\n1.4.4 Using packages\nOnce you have installed a package onto your computer it is not immediately available for you to use. To use a package you first need to load the package by using the library() function. For example, to load the remotes package you previously installed\n\nlibrary(remotes)\n\nThe library() function will also load any additional packages required and may print out additional package information. It is important to realise that every time you start a new R session (or restore a previously saved session) you need to load the packages you will be using. We tend to put all our library() statements required for our analysis near the top of our R scripts to make them easily accessible and easy to add to as our code develops. If you try to use a function without first loading the relevant R package you will receive an error message that R could not find the function. For example, if you try to use the install_github() function without loading the remotes package first you will receive the following error\n\ninstall_github('tidyverse/dplyr')\n\n# Error in install_github(\"tidyverse/dplyr\") : \n#  could not find function \"install_github\"\n\nSometimes it can be useful to use a function without first using the library() function. If, for example, you will only be using one or two functions in your script and don’t want to load all of the other functions in a package then you can access the function directly by specifying the package name followed by two colons and then the function name\n\nremotes::install_github('tidyverse/dplyr')\n\nThis is how we were able to use the install() and install_github() functions above without first loading the packages BiocManager and remotes. Most of the time we recommend using the library() function.",

    "section": "\n1.5 Projects organisation",
    "text": "1.5 Projects organisation\nAs with most things in life, when it comes to dealing with data and data analysis things are so much simpler if you’re organised. Clear project organisation makes it easier for both you (especially the future you) and your collaborators to make sense of what you’ve done. There’s nothing more frustrating than coming back to a project months (sometimes years) later and have to spend days (or weeks) figuring out where everything is, what you did and why you did it. A well documented project that has a consistent and logical structure increases the likelihood that you can pick up where you left off with minimal fuss no matter how much time has passed. In addition, it’s much easier to write code to automate tasks when files are well organised and are sensibly named. This is even more relevant nowadays as it’s never been easier to collect vast amounts of data which can be saved across 1000’s or even 100,000’s of separate data files. Lastly, having a well organised project reduces the risk of introducing bugs or errors into your workflow and if they do occur (which inevitably they will at some point), it makes it easier to track down these errors and deal with them efficiently.\nThere are also a few simple steps you can take right at the start of any project to help keep things shipshape.\nA great way of keeping things organized is to use RStudio Projects or VSCode workspaces, referred after as project. A project keeps all of your R scripts, R markdown documents, R functions and data together in one place. The nice thing about project is that each has its own directory, history and source documents so different analyses that you are working on are kept completely separate from each other. This means that you can very easily switch between projects without fear of them interfering with each other.\n \n\n1.5.1 RStudio\nTo create a project, open RStudio and select File -&gt; New Project... from the menu. You can create either an entirely new project, a project from an existing directory or a version controlled project (see the GitHub Chapter for further details about this). In this Chapter we will create a project in a new directory.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also create a new project by clicking on the ‘Project’ button in the top right of RStudio and selecting ‘New Project…’\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the next window select ‘New Project’.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow enter the name of the directory you want to create in the ‘Directory name:’ field (we’ll call it first_project for this Chapter). If you want to change the location of the directory on your computer click the ‘Browse…’ button and navigate to where you would like to create the directory. We always tick the ‘Open in new session’ box as well. Finally, hit the ‘Create Project’ to create the new project.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOnce your new project has been created you will now have a new folder on your computer that contains an RStudio project file called first_project.Rproj. This .Rproj file contains various project options (but you shouldn’t really interact with it) and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the file system (just double click on it). You can check this out in the ‘Files’ tab in RStudio (or in Finder if you’re on a Mac or File Explorer in Windows).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe last thing we suggest you do is select Tools -&gt; Project Options... from the menu. Click on the ‘General’ tab on the left hand side and then change the values for ‘Restore .RData into workspace at startup’ and ‘Save workspace to .RData on exit’ from ‘Default’ to ‘No’. This ensures that every time you open your project you start with a clean R session. You don’t have to do this (many people don’t) but we prefer to start with a completely clean workspace whenever we open our projects to avoid any potential conflicts with things we have done in previous sessions. The downside to this is that you will need to rerun your R code every time you open your project.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow that you have an RStudio project set up you can start creating R scripts (or R markdown documents) or whatever you need to complete you project. All of the R scripts will now be contained within the RStudio project and saved in the project folder.\n\n1.5.2 VSCode\nworkspace are similar to RStudio projects. You however need to create a new folder with a R file (or text file) and save as workspace.",

    "section": "\n1.6 Working directories",
    "text": "1.6 Working directories\nThe working directory is the default location where R will look for files you want to load and where it will put any files you save. One of the great things about using RStudio Projects is that when you open a project it will automatically set your working directory to the appropriate location. You can check the file path of your working directory by looking at bar at the top of the Console pane. Note: the ~ symbol above is shorthand for /Users/nhy163/ on a Mac computer (the same on Linux computers).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can also use the getwd() function in the Console which returns the file path of the current working directory.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the example above, the working directory is a folder called ‘first_project’ which is a subfolder of “Teaching’ in the ‘Alex’ folder which in turn is in a ‘Documents’ folder located in the ‘nhy163’ folder which itself is in the ‘Users’ folder. On a Windows based computer our working directory would also include a drive letter (i.e. C:/Users/nhy163/Documents/Alex/Teaching/first_project).\nIf you weren’t using an RStudio Project then you would have to set your working directory using the setwd() function at the start of every R script (something we did for many years).\n\nsetwd('/Users/nhy163/Documents/Alex/Teaching/first_project')\n\nHowever, the problem with setwd() is that it uses an absolute file path which is specific to the computer you are working on. If you want to send your script to someone else (or if you’re working on a different computer) this absolute file path is not going to work on your friend/colleagues computer as their directory configuration will be different (you are unlikely to have a directory structure /Users/nhy163/Documents/Alex/Teaching/ on your computer). This results in a project that is not self-contained and not easily portable. RStudio solves this problem by allowing you to use relative file paths which are relative to the Root project directory. The Root project directory is just the directory that contains the .Rproj file (first_project.Rproj in our case). If you want to share your analysis with someone else, all you need to do is copy the entire project directory and send to your to your collaborator. They would then just need to open the project file and any R scripts that contain references to relative file paths will just work. For example, let’s say that you’ve created a subdirectory called raw_data in your Root project directory that contains a tab delimited datafile called mydata.txt (we will cover directory structures below). To import this datafile in an RStudio project using the read.table() function (don’t worry about this now, we will cover this in much more detail in Chapter 3) all you need to include in your R script is\n\ndataf &lt;- read.table('raw_data/mydata.txt', header = TRUE, \n                      sep = '\\t')\n\nBecause the file path raw_data/mydata.txt is relative to the project directory it doesn’t matter where you collaborator saves the project directory on their computer it will still work.\nIf you weren’t using an RStudio project then you would have to use either of the options below neither of which would work on a different computer.\n\nsetwd(\"/Users/nhy163/Documents/Alex/Teaching/first_project/\")\n\ndataf &lt;- read.table(\"raw_data/mydata.txt\", header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\")\n\n# or\n\ndataf &lt;- read.table(\"/Users/nhy163/Documents/Alex/Teaching/first_project/raw_data/mydata.txt\",\n    header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\")\n\nFor those of you who want to take the notion of relative file paths a step further, take a look at the here() function in the here package. The here() function allows you to automagically build file paths for any file relative to the project root directory that are also operating system agnostic (works on a Mac, Windows or Linux machine). For example, to import our mydata.txt file from the raw_data directory just use\n\nlibrary(here)  # you may need to install the here package first\ndataf &lt;- read.table(here(\"raw_data\", \"mydata.txt\"), \n                     header = TRUE, sep = '\\t',\n                    stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\n# or without loading the here package\n\ndataf &lt;- read.table(here::here(\"raw_data\", \"mydata.txt\"), \n                      header = TRUE, sep = '\\t', \n                      stringsAsFactors = TRUE)",

    "text": "1.7 Directory structure\nIn addition to using RStudio Projects, it’s also really good practice to structure your working directory in a consistent and logical way to help both you and your collaborators. We frequently use the following directory structure in our R based projects\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn our working directory we have the following directories:\n\nRoot - This is your project directory containing your .Rproj file.\ndata - We store all our data in this directory. The subdirectory called raw_data contains raw data files and only raw data files. These files should be treated as read only and should not be changed in any way. If you need to process/clean/modify your data do this in R (not MS Excel) as you can document (and justify) any changes made. Any processed data should be saved to a separate file and stored in the processed_data subdirectory. Information about data collection methods, details of data download and any other useful metadata should be saved in a text document (see README text files below) in the metadata subdirectory.\nR - This is an optional directory where we save all of the custom R functions we’ve written for the current analysis. These can then be sourced into R using the source() function.\nRmd - An optional directory where we save our R markdown documents.\nscripts - All of the main R scripts we have written for the current project are saved here.\noutput - Outputs from our R scripts such as plots, HTML files and data summaries are saved in this directory. This helps us and our collaborators distinguish what files are outputs and which are source files.\n\nOf course, the structure described above is just what works for us most of the time and should be viewed as a starting point for your own needs. We tend to have a fairly consistent directory structure across our projects as this allows us to quickly orientate ourselves when we return to a project after a while. Having said that, different projects will have different requirements so we happily add and remove directories as required.\nYou can create your directory structure using Windows Explorer (or Finder on a Mac) or within RStudio by clicking on the ‘New folder’ button in the ‘Files’ pane.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAn alternative approach is to use the dir.create() and list.files() functions in the R Console\n\n# create directory called 'data'\ndir.create('data')\n\n# create subdirectory raw_data in the data directory\ndir.create('data/raw_data')\n\n# list the files and directories\nlist.files(recursive = TRUE, include.dirs = TRUE)\n\n# [1] \"data\"  \"data/raw_data\"   \"first_project.Rproj\"",

    "text": "1.8 File names\nWhat you call your files matters more than you might think. Naming files is also more difficult than you think. The key requirement for a ‘good’ file name is that it’s informative whilst also being relatively short. This is not always an easy compromise and often requires some thought. Ideally you should try to avoid the following!\n \n\n\n\n\nsource:https://xkcd.com/1459/\n\n\n\n \nAlthough there’s not really a recognised standard approach to naming files (actually there is, just not everyone uses it), there are a couple of things to bear in mind.\n\nFirst, avoid using spaces in file names by replacing them with underscores or even hyphens. Why does this matter? One reason is that some command line software (especially many bioinformatic tools) won’t recognise a file name with a space and you’ll have to go through all sorts of shenanigans using escape characters to make sure spaces are handled correctly. Even if you don’t think you will ever use command line software you may be doing so indirectly. Take R markdown for example, if you want to render an R markdown document to pdf using the rmarkdown package you will actually be using a command line LaTeX engine under the hood (called Pandoc). Another good reason not to use spaces in file names is that it makes searching for file names (or parts of file names) using regular expressions in R (or any other language) much more difficult.\nFor the reasons given above, also avoid using special characters (i.e. @£$%^&*(:/) in your file names.\nIf you are versioning your files with sequential numbers (i.e. file1, file2, file3 …) and you have more than 9 files you should use 01, 02, 03 .. 10 as this will ensure the files are printed in the correct order (see what happens if you don’t). If you have more than 99 files then use 001, 002, 003… etc.\nIf your file names include dates, use the ISO 8601 format YYYY-MM-DD (or YYYYMMDD) to ensure your files are listed in proper chronological order.\nNever use the word final in any file name - it never is!\n\nWhatever file naming convention you decide to use, try to adopt early, stick with it and be consistent.

    "text": "1.9 Project documentation\nA quick note or two about writing R code and creating R scripts. Unless you’re doing something really quick and dirty we suggest that you always write your R code as an R script. R scripts are what make R so useful. Not only do you have a complete record of your analysis, from data manipulation, visualisation and statistical analysis, you can also share this code (and data) with friends, colleagues and importantly when you submit and publish your research to a journal. With this in mind, make sure you include in your R script all the information required to make your work reproducible (author names, dates, sampling design etc). This information could be included as a series of comments # or, even better, by mixing executable code with narrative into an R markdown document. It’s also good practice to include the output of the sessionInfo() function at the end of any script which prints the R version, details of the operating system and also loaded packages. A really good alternative is to use the session_info() function from the xfun package for a more concise summary of our session environment.\nHere’s an example of including meta-information at the start of an R script\n\n# Title: Time series analysis of snouters\n\n# Purpose : This script performs a time series analyses on \n#           snouter count data.\n#           Data consists of counts of snouter species \n#           collected from 18 islands in the Hy-yi-yi \n#           archipelago between 1950 and 1957. \n#           For details of snouter biology see:\n#           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinogradentia\n\n# Project number: #007\n\n# DataFile:'data/snouter_pop.txt'\n\n# Author: A. Nother\n# Contact details: a.nother@uir.ac.uk\n\n# Date script created: Mon Dec 2 16:06:44 2019 -----------\n# Date script last modified: Thu Dec 12 16:07:12 2019 ----\n\n# package dependencies\nlibrary(PopSnouter)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nprint('put your lovely R code here')\n\n# good practice to include session information\n\nxfun::session_info()\n\nThis is just one example and there are no hard and fast rules so feel free to develop a system that works for you. A really useful shortcut in RStudio is to automatically include a time and date stamp in your R script. To do this, write ts where you want to insert your time stamp in your R script and then press the ‘shift + tab’ keys. RStudio will magically convert ts into the current date and time and also automatically comment out this line with a #. Another really useful RStudio shortcut is to comment out multiple lines in your script with a # symbol. To do this, highlight the lines of text you want to comment and then press ‘ctrl + shift + c’ (or ‘cmd + shift + c’ on a mac). To uncomment the lines just use ‘ctrl + shift + c’ again.\nIn addition to including metadata in your R scripts it’s also common practice to create a separate text file to record important information. By convention these text files are named README. We often include a README file in the directory where we keep our raw data. In this file we include details about when data were collected (or downloaded), how data were collected, information about specialised equipment, preservation methods, type and version of any machines used (i.e. sequencing equipment) etc. You can create a README file for your project in RStudio by clicking on the File -&gt; New File -&gt; Text File menu.",

Always think of the absolute worst case scenario, something that makes you wake up in a cold sweat at night, and do all you can to make sure this never happens. Just to be clear, if you’re relying on copying your precious files to an external hard disk or USB stick this is NOT an effective backup strategy. These things go wrong all the time as you lob them into your rucksack or ‘bag for life’ and then lug them between your office and home. Even if you do leave them plugged into your computer what happens when the building burns down (we did say worst case!)?\nIdeally, your backups should be offsite and incremental. Happily there are numerous options for backing up your files. The first place to look is in your own institute. Most (all?) Universities have some form of network based storage that should be easily accessible and is also underpinned by a comprehensive disaster recovery plan. Other options include cloud based services such as Google Drive and Dropbox (to name but a few), but make sure you’re not storing sensitive data on these services and are comfortable with the often eye watering privacy policies.\nWhilst these services are pretty good at storing files, they don’t really help with incremental backups. Finding previous versions of files often involves spending inordinate amounts of time trawling through multiple files named ‘final.doc’, ‘final_v2.doc’ and ‘final_usethisone.doc’ etc until you find the one you were looking for. The best way we know for both backing up files and managing different versions of files is to use Git and GitHub.

    "text": "2.1 Getting started\nIn Chapter 1 we learned about the R Console and creating scripts and Projects. We also saw how you write your R code in a script and then source this code into the console to get it to run (if you’ve forgotten how to do this, pop back to the console section to refresh your memory). Writing your code in a script means that you’ll always have a permanent record of everything you’ve done (provided you save your script) and also allows you to make loads of comments to remind your future self what you’ve done. So, while you’re working through this Chapter we suggest that you create a new script (or RStudio Project) to write your code as you follow along.\nAs we saw in the previous Chapter, at a basic level we can use R much as you would use a calculator. We can type an arithmetic expression into our script, then source it into the console and receive a result. For example, if we type the expression 2 + 2 and then source this line of code we get the answer 4 (reassuringly!)\n2 + 2\n\n[1] 4\nThe [1] in front of the result tells you that the observation number at the beginning of the line is the first observation. This is not much help in this example, but can be quite useful when printing results with multiple lines (we’ll see an example below). The other obvious arithmetic operators are -, *, / for subtraction, multiplication and division respectively. R follows the usual mathematical convention of order of operations. For example, the expression 2 + 3 * 4 is interpreted to have the value 2 + (3 * 4) = 14, not (2 + 3) * 4 = 20. There are a huge range of mathematical functions in R, some of the most useful include; log(), log10(), exp(), sqrt().\nlog(1)              # logarithm to base e\n\n[1] 0\n\nlog10(1)            # logarithm to base 10\n\n[1] 0\n\nexp(1)              # natural antilog\n\n[1] 2.718282\n\nsqrt(4)             # square root\n\n[1] 2\n\n4^2                   # 4 to the power of 2\n\n[1] 16\n\npi                    # not a function but useful\n\n[1] 3.141593\nIt’s important to realise that when you run code as we’ve done above, the result of the code (or value) is only displayed in the console. Whilst this can sometimes be useful it is usually much more practical to store the value(s) in a object.",

    "section": "\n2.2 Objects in R",
    "text": "2.2 Objects in R\nAt the heart of almost everything you will do (or ever likely to do) in R is the concept that everything in R is an object. These objects can be almost anything, from a single number or character string (like a word) to highly complex structures like the output of a plot, a summary of your statistical analysis or a set of R commands that perform a specific task. Understanding how you create objects and assign values to objects is key to understanding R.\n\n2.2.1 Creating objects\nTo create an object we simply give the object a name. We can then assign a value to this object using the assignment operator &lt;- (sometimes called the gets operator). The assignment operator is a composite symbol comprised of a ‘less than’ symbol &lt; and a hyphen - .\n\nmy_obj &lt;- 48\n\nIn the code above, we created an object called my_obj and assigned it a value of the number 48 using the assignment operator (in our head we always read this as ‘my_obj gets 48’). You can also use = instead of &lt;- to assign values but this is considered bad practice and we would discourage you from using this notation.\nTo view the value of the object you simply type the name of the object\n\nmy_obj\n\n[1] 48\n\n\nNow that we’ve created this object, R knows all about it and will keep track of it during this current R session. All of the objects you create will be stored in the current workspace and you can view all the objects in your workspace in RStudio by clicking on the ‘Environment’ tab in the top right hand pane.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you click on the down arrow on the ‘List’ icon in the same pane and change to ‘Grid’ view RStudio will show you a summary of the objects including the type (numeric - it’s a number), the length (only one value in this object), its ‘physical’ size and its value (48 in this case).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThere are many different types of values that you can assign to an object. For example\n\nmy_obj2 &lt;- \"R is cool\"\n\nHere we have created an object called my_obj2 and assigned it a value of R is cool which is a character string. Notice that we have enclosed the string in quotes. If you forget to use the quotes you will receive an error message.\nOur workspace now contains both objects we’ve created so far with my_obj2 listed as type character.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo change the value of an existing object we simply reassign a new value to it. For example, to change the value of my_obj2 from \"R is cool\" to the number 1024\n\nmy_obj2 &lt;- 1024\n\nNotice that the Type has changed to numeric and the value has changed to 1024 in the environment\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOnce we have created a few objects, we can do stuff with our objects. For example, the following code creates a new object my_obj3 and assigns it the value of my_obj added to my_obj2 which is 1072 (48 + 1024 = 1072).\n\nmy_obj3 &lt;- my_obj + my_obj2\nmy_obj3\n\n[1] 1072\n\n\nNotice that to display the value of my_obj3 we also need to write the object’s name. The above code works because the values of both my_obj and my_obj2 are numeric (i.e. a number). If you try to do this with objects with character values (character class) you will receive an error\n\nchar_obj &lt;- \"hello\"\nchar_obj2 &lt;- \"world!\"\nchar_obj3 &lt;- char_obj + char_obj2\n# Error in char_obj+char_obj2:non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\nThe error message is essentially telling you that either one or both of the objects char_obj and char_obj2 is not a number and therefore cannot be added together.\nWhen you first start learning R, dealing with errors and warnings can be frustrating as they’re often difficult to understand (what’s an argument? what’s a binary operator?). One way to find out more information about a particular error is to Google a generalised version of the error message. For the above error try Googling ‘non-numeric argument to binary operator error + r’ or even ‘common r error messages’.\nAnother error message that you’ll get quite a lot when you first start using R is Error: object 'XXX' not found. As an example, take a look at the code below\n\nmy_obj &lt;- 48\nmy_obj4 &lt;- my_obj + no_obj\n# Error: object 'no_obj' not found\n\nR returns an error message because we haven’t created (defined) the object no_obj yet. Another clue that there’s a problem with this code is that, if you check your environment, you’ll see that object my_obj4 has not been created.\n\n2.2.2 Naming objects\nNaming your objects is one of the most difficult things you will do in R. Ideally your object names should be kept both short and informative which is not always easy. If you need to create objects with multiple words in their name then use either an underscore or a dot between words or capitalise the different words. We prefer the underscore format and never include uppercases in names (called snake case)\n\noutput_summary &lt;- \"my analysis\" # recommended#\noutput.summary &lt;- \"my analysis\"\noutputSummary &lt;- \"my analysis\"\n\nThere are also a few limitations when it come to giving objects names. An object name cannot start with a number or a dot followed by a number (i.e. 2my_variable or .2my_variable). You should also avoid using non-alphanumeric characters in your object names (i.e. &, ^, /, ! etc). In addition, make sure you don’t name your objects with reserved words (i.e. TRUE, NA) and it’s never a good idea to give your object the same name as a built-in function. One that crops up more times than we can remember is\n\ndata &lt;- read.table(\"mydatafile\", header = TRUE) #data is a\n                                                # function!",

    "section": "\n2.3 Using functions in R",
    "text": "2.3 Using functions in R\nUp until now we’ve been creating simple objects by directly assigning a single value to an object. It’s very likely that you’ll soon want to progress to creating more complicated objects as your R experience grows and the complexity of your tasks increase. Happily, R has a multitude of functions to help you do this. You can think of a function as an object which contains a series of instructions to perform a specific task. The base installation of R comes with many functions already defined or you can increase the power of R by installing one of the 10000’s of packages now available. Once you get a bit more experience with using R you may want to define your own functions to perform tasks that are specific to your goals (more about this in Chapter 6).\n \nThe first function we will learn about is the c() function. The c() function is short for concatenate and we use it to join together a series of values and store them in a data structure called a vector (more on vectors in Chapter 3).\n\nmy_vec &lt;- c(2, 3, 1, 6, 4, 3, 3, 7)\n\nIn the code above we’ve created an object called my_vec and assigned it a value using the function c(). There are a couple of really important points to note here. Firstly, when you use a function in R, the function name is always followed by a pair of round brackets even if there’s nothing contained between the brackets. Secondly, the argument(s) of a function are placed inside the round brackets and are separated by commas. You can think of an argument as way of customising the use or behaviour of a function. In the example above, the arguments are the numbers we want to concatenate. Finally, one of the tricky things when you first start using R is to know which function to use for a particular task and how to use it. Thankfully each function will always have a help document associated with it which will explain how to use the function (more on this later) and a quick Google search will also usually help you out.\nTo examine the value of our new object we can simply type out the name of the object as we did before\n\nmy_vec\n\n[1] 2 3 1 6 4 3 3 7\n\n\nNow that we’ve created a vector we can use other functions to do useful stuff with this object. For example, we can calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation and number of elements in our vector by using the mean(), var(), sd() and length() functions\n\nmean(my_vec)    # returns the mean of my_vec\n\n[1] 3.625\n\nvar(my_vec)     # returns the variance of my_vec\n\n[1] 3.982143\n\nsd(my_vec)      # returns the standard deviation of my_vec\n\n[1] 1.995531\n\nlength(my_vec)  # returns the number of elements in my_vec\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nIf we wanted to use any of these values later on in our analysis we can just assign the resulting value to another object\n\nvec_mean &lt;- mean(my_vec)    # returns the mean of my_vec\nvec_mean\n\n[1] 3.625\n\n\nSometimes it can be useful to create a vector that contains a regular sequence of values in steps of one. Here we can make use of a shortcut using the : symbol.\n\nmy_seq &lt;- 1:10     # create regular sequence\nmy_seq\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nmy_seq2 &lt;- 10:1    # in decending order\nmy_seq2\n\n [1] 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1\n\n\nOther useful functions for generating vectors of sequences include the seq() and rep() functions. For example, to generate a sequence from 1 to 5 in steps of 0.5\n\nmy_seq2 &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 5, by = 0.5)\nmy_seq2\n\n[1] 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 4.5 5.0\n\n\nHere we’ve used the arguments from = and to = to define the limits of the sequence and the by = argument to specify the increment of the sequence. Play around with other values for these arguments to see their effect.\nThe rep() function allows you to replicate (repeat) values a specified number of times. To repeat the value 2, 10 times\n\nmy_seq3 &lt;- rep(2, times = 10)   # repeats 2, 10 times\nmy_seq3\n\n [1] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n\nYou can also repeat non-numeric values\n\nmy_seq4 &lt;- rep(\"abc\", times = 3)    # repeats ‘abc’ 3 times \nmy_seq4\n\n[1] \"abc\" \"abc\" \"abc\"\n\n\nor each element of a series\n\nmy_seq5 &lt;- rep(1:5, times = 3)  # repeats the series 1 to \n                                # 5, 3 times\nmy_seq5\n\n [1] 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nor elements of a series\n\nmy_seq6 &lt;- rep(1:5, each = 3)   # repeats each element of the \n                              #series 3 times\nmy_seq6\n\n [1] 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 5 5 5\n\n\nWe can also repeat a non-sequential series\n\nmy_seq7 &lt;- rep(c(3, 1, 10, 7), each = 3) # repeats each \n                                         # element of the \n                                         # series 3 times\nmy_seq7\n\n [1]  3  3  3  1  1  1 10 10 10  7  7  7\n\n\nNote in the code above how we’ve used the c() function inside the rep() function. Nesting functions allows us to build quite complex commands within a single line of code and is a very common practice when using R. However, care needs to be taken as too many nested functions can make your code quite difficult for others to understand (or yourself some time in the future!). We could rewrite the code above to explicitly separate the two different steps to generate our vector. Either approach will give the same result, you just need to use your own judgement as to which is more readable.\n\nin_vec &lt;- c(3, 1, 10, 7)\nmy_seq7 &lt;- rep(in_vec, each = 3)    # repeats each element of \n                                  # the series 3 times\nmy_seq7\n\n [1]  3  3  3  1  1  1 10 10 10  7  7  7",

    "section": "\n2.4 Working with vectors",
    "text": "2.4 Working with vectors\nManipulating, summarising and sorting data using R is an important skill to master but one which many people find a little confusing at first. We’ll go through a few simple examples here using vectors to illustrate some important concepts but will build on this in much more detail in Chapter 3 where we will look at more complicated (and useful) data structures.\n \n\n2.4.1 Extracting elements\nTo extract (also known as indexing or subscripting) one or more values (more generally known as elements) from a vector we use the square bracket [ ] notation. The general approach is to name the object you wish to extract from, then a set of square brackets with an index of the element you wish to extract contained within the square brackets. This index can be a position or the result of a logical test.\nPositional index\nTo extract elements based on their position we simply write the position inside the [ ]. For example, to extract the 3rd value of my_vec\n\nmy_vec        # remind ourselves what my_vec looks like\n\n[1] 2 3 1 6 4 3 3 7\n\nmy_vec[3]     # extract the 3rd value\n\n[1] 1\n\n# if you want to store this value in another object\nval_3 &lt;- my_vec[3]\nval_3\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nNote that the positional index starts at 1 rather than 0 like some other other programming languages (i.e. Python).\nWe can also extract more than one value by using the c() function inside the square brackets. Here we extract the 1st, 5th, 6th and 8th element from the my_vec object\n\nmy_vec[c(1, 5, 6, 8)]\n\n[1] 2 4 3 7\n\n\nOr we can extract a range of values using the : notation. To extract the values from the 3rd to the 8th elements\n\nmy_vec[3:8]\n\n[1] 1 6 4 3 3 7\n\n\nLogical index\nAnother really useful way to extract data from a vector is to use a logical expression as an index. For example, to extract all elements with a value greater than 4 in the vector my_vec\n\nmy_vec[my_vec &gt; 4]\n\n[1] 6 7\n\n\nHere, the logical expression is my_vec &gt; 4 and R will only extract those elements that satisfy this logical condition. So how does this actually work? If we look at the output of just the logical expression without the square brackets you can see that R returns a vector containing either TRUE or FALSE which correspond to whether the logical condition is satisfied for each element. In this case only the 4th and 8th elements return a TRUE as their value is greater than 4.\n\nmy_vec &gt; 4\n\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE\n\n\nSo what R is actually doing under the hood is equivalent to\n\nmy_vec[c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]\n\n[1] 6 7\n\n\nand only those element that are TRUE will be extracted.\nIn addition to the &lt; and &gt; operators you can also use composite operators to increase the complexity of your expressions. For example the expression for ‘greater or equal to’ is &gt;=. To test whether a value is equal to a value we need to use a double equals symbol == and for ‘not equal to’ we use != (the ! symbol means ‘not’).\n\nmy_vec[my_vec &gt;= 4]        # values greater or equal to 4\n\n[1] 6 4 7\n\nmy_vec[my_vec &lt; 4]         # values less than 4\n\n[1] 2 3 1 3 3\n\nmy_vec[my_vec &lt;= 4]        # values less than or equal to 4\n\n[1] 2 3 1 4 3 3\n\nmy_vec[my_vec == 4]        # values equal to 4\n\n[1] 4\n\nmy_vec[my_vec != 4]        # values not equal to 4\n\n[1] 2 3 1 6 3 3 7\n\n\nWe can also combine multiple logical expressions using Boolean expressions. In R the & symbol means AND and the | symbol means OR. For example, to extract values in my_vec which are less than 6 AND greater than 2\n\nval26 &lt;- my_vec[my_vec &lt; 6 & my_vec &gt; 2]\nval26\n\n[1] 3 4 3 3\n\n\nor extract values in my_vec that are greater than 6 OR less than 3\n\nval63 &lt;- my_vec[my_vec &gt; 6 | my_vec &lt; 3]\nval63\n\n[1] 2 1 7\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Replacing elements\nWe can change the values of some elements in a vector using our [ ] notation in combination with the assignment operator &lt;-. For example, to replace the 4th value of our my_vec object from 6 to 500\n\nmy_vec[4] &lt;- 500\nmy_vec\n\n[1]   2   3   1 500   4   3   3   7\n\n\nWe can also replace more than one value or even replace values based on a logical expression\n\n# replace the 6th and 7th element with 100\nmy_vec[c(6, 7)] &lt;- 100\nmy_vec\n\n[1]   2   3   1 500   4 100 100   7\n\n# replace element that are less than or equal to 4 with 1000\nmy_vec[my_vec &lt;= 4] &lt;- 1000\nmy_vec\n\n[1] 1000 1000 1000  500 1000  100  100    7\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Ordering elements\nIn addition to extracting particular elements from a vector we can also order the values contained in a vector. To sort the values from lowest to highest value we can use the sort() function\n\nvec_sort &lt;- sort(my_vec)\nvec_sort\n\n[1]    7  100  100  500 1000 1000 1000 1000\n\n\nTo reverse the sort, from highest to lowest, we can either include the decreasing = TRUE argument when using the sort() function\n\nvec_sort2 &lt;- sort(my_vec, decreasing = TRUE)\nvec_sort2\n\n[1] 1000 1000 1000 1000  500  100  100    7\n\n\nor first sort the vector using the sort() function and then reverse the sorted vector using the rev() function. This is another example of nesting one function inside another function.\n\nvec_sort3 &lt;- rev(sort(my_vec))\nvec_sort3\n\n[1] 1000 1000 1000 1000  500  100  100    7\n\n\nWhilst sorting a single vector is fun, perhaps a more useful task would be to sort one vector according to the values of another vector. To do this we should use the order() function in combination with [ ]. To demonstrate this let’s create a vector called height containing the height of 5 different people and another vector called p.names containing the names of these people (so Joanna is 180 cm, Charlotte is 155 cm etc)\n\nheight &lt;- c(180, 155, 160, 167, 181)\nheight\n\n[1] 180 155 160 167 181\n\np.names &lt;- c(\"Joanna\", \"Charlotte\", \"Helen\", \"Karen\", \"Amy\")\np.names\n\n[1] \"Joanna\"    \"Charlotte\" \"Helen\"     \"Karen\"     \"Amy\"      \n\n\nOur goal is to order the people in p.names in ascending order of their height. The first thing we’ll do is use the order() function with the height variable to create a vector called height_ord\n\nheight_ord &lt;- order(height)\nheight_ord\n\n[1] 2 3 4 1 5\n\n\nOK, what’s going on here? The first value, 2, (remember ignore [1]) should be read as ‘the smallest value of height is the second element of the height vector’. If we check this by looking at the height vector above, you can see that element 2 has a value of 155, which is the smallest value. The second smallest value in height is the 3rd element of height, which when we check is 160 and so on. The largest value of height is element 5 which is 181. Now that we have a vector of the positional indices of heights in ascending order (height_ord), we can extract these values from our p.names vector in this order\n\nnames_ord &lt;- p.names[height_ord]\nnames_ord\n\n[1] \"Charlotte\" \"Helen\"     \"Karen\"     \"Joanna\"    \"Amy\"      \n\n\nYou’re probably thinking ‘what’s the use of this?’ Well, imagine you have a dataset which contains two columns of data and you want to sort each column. If you just use sort() to sort each column separately, the values of each column will become uncoupled from each other. By using the ‘order()’ on one column, a vector of positional indices is created of the values of the column in ascending order This vector can be used on the second column, as the index of elements which will return a vector of values based on the first column.\n\n2.4.4 Vectorisation\nOne of the great things about R functions is that most of them are vectorised. This means that the function will operate on all elements of a vector without needing to apply the function on each element separately. For example, to multiple each element of a vector by 5 we can simply use\n\n# create a vector\nmy_vec2 &lt;- c(3, 5, 7, 1, 9, 20)\n\n# multiply each element by 5\nmy_vec2 * 5\n\n[1]  15  25  35   5  45 100\n\n\nOr we can add the elements of two or more vectors\n\n# create a second vector\nmy_vec3 &lt;- c(17, 15, 13, 19, 11, 0)\n\n# add both vectors\nmy_vec2 + my_vec3\n\n[1] 20 20 20 20 20 20\n\n# multiply both vectors\nmy_vec2 * my_vec3\n\n[1] 51 75 91 19 99  0\n\n\nHowever, you must be careful when using vectorisation with vectors of different lengths as R will quietly recycle the elements in the shorter vector rather than throw a wobbly (error).\n\n# create a third vector\nmy_vec4 &lt;- c(1, 2)\n\n# add both vectors - quiet recycling!\nmy_vec2 + my_vec4\n\n[1]  4  7  8  3 10 22\n\n\n\n2.4.5 Missing data\nIn R, missing data is usually represented by an NA symbol meaning ‘Not Available’. Data may be missing for a whole bunch of reasons, maybe your machine broke down, maybe you broke down, maybe the weather was too bad to collect data on a particular day etc etc. Missing data can be a pain in the proverbial both from an R perspective and also a statistical perspective. From an R perspective missing data can be problematic as different functions deal with missing data in different ways. For example, let’s say we collected air temperature readings over 10 days, but our thermometer broke on day 2 and again on day 9 so we have no data for those days\n\ntemp  &lt;- c(7.2, NA, 7.1, 6.9, 6.5, 5.8, 5.8, 5.5, NA, 5.5)\ntemp\n\n [1] 7.2  NA 7.1 6.9 6.5 5.8 5.8 5.5  NA 5.5\n\n\nWe now want to calculate the mean temperature over these days using the mean() function\n\nmean_temp &lt;- mean(temp)\nmean_temp\n\n[1] NA\n\n\nFlippin heck, what’s happened here? Why does the mean() function return an NA? Actually, R is doing something very sensible (at least in our opinion!). If a vector has a missing value then the only possible value to return when calculating a mean is NA. R doesn’t know that you perhaps want to ignore the NA values (R can’t read your mind - yet!). Happily, if we look at the help file (use help(\"mean\") - see the next section for more details) associated with the mean() function we can see there is an argument na.rm = which is set to FALSE by default.\n\nna.rm - a logical value indicating whether NA values should be stripped before the computation proceeds.\n\nIf we change this argument to na.rm = TRUE when we use the mean() function this will allow us to ignore the NA values when calculating the mean\n\nmean_temp &lt;- mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)\nmean_temp\n\n[1] 6.2875\n\n\nIt’s important to note that the NA values have not been removed from our temp object (that would be bad practice), rather the mean() function has just ignored them. The point of the above is to highlight how we can change the default behaviour of a function using an appropriate argument. The problem is that not all functions will have an na.rm = argument, they might deal with NA values differently. However, the good news is that every help file associated with any function will always tell you how missing data are handled by default.",

    "text": "2.5 Getting help\nThis book is intended as a relatively brief introduction to R and as such you will soon be using functions and packages that go beyond this scope of this introductory text. Fortunately, one of the strengths of R is its comprehensive and easily accessible help system and wealth of online resources where you can obtain further information.\n\n2.5.1 R help\nTo access R’s built-in help facility to get information on any function simply use the help() function. For example, to open the help page for our friend the mean() function.\n\nhelp(\"mean\")\n\nor you can use the equivalent shortcut\n\n?mean\n\nthe help page is displayed in the ‘Help’ tab in the Files pane (usually in the bottom right of RStudio)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAdmittedly the help files can seem anything but helpful when you first start using R. This is probably because they’re written in a very concise manner and the language used is often quite technical and full of jargon. Having said that, you do get used to this and will over time even come to appreciate a certain beauty in their brevity (honest!). One of the great things about the help files is that they all have a very similar structure regardless of the function. This makes it easy to navigate through the file to find exactly what you need.\nThe first line of the help document contains information such as the name of the function and the package where the function can be found. There are also other headings that provide more specific information such as\n\nDescription: gives a brief description of the function and what it does.\nUsage: gives the name of the arguments associated with the function and possible default values.\nArguments: provides more detail regarding each argument and what they do.\nDetails: gives further details of the function if required.\nValue: if applicable, gives the type and structure of the object returned by the function or the operator.\nSee Also: provides information on other help pages with similar or related content.\nExamples: gives some examples of using the function. These are really helpful, all you need to do is copy and paste them into the console to see what happens. You can also access examples at any time by using the example() function (i.e. example(\"mean\"))\n\nThe help() function is useful if you know the name of the function. If you’re not sure of the name, but can remember a key word then you can search R’s help system using the help.search() function.\n\nhelp.search(\"mean\")\n\nor you can use the equivalent shortcut\n\n??mean\n\nThe results of the search will be displayed in RStudio under the ‘Help’ tab as before. The help.search() function searches through the help documentation, code demonstrations and package vignettes and displays the results as clickable links for further exploration.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAnother useful function is apropos(). This function can be used to list all functions containing a specified character string. For example, to find all functions with mean in their name\n\napropos(\"mean\")\n\n [1] \".colMeans\"     \".rowMeans\"     \"colMeans\"      \"kmeans\"       \n [5] \"mean\"          \"mean_temp\"     \"mean.Date\"     \"mean.default\" \n [9] \"mean.difftime\" \"mean.POSIXct\"  \"mean.POSIXlt\"  \"rowMeans\"     \n[13] \"vec_mean\"      \"weighted.mean\"\n\n\nYou can then bring up the help file for the relevant function.\n\nhelp(\"kmeans\")\n\nAn extremely useful function is RSiteSearch() which enables you to search for keywords and phrases in function help pages and vignettes for all CRAN packages, and in CRAN task views. This function allows you to access the https://www.r-project.org/search.html search engine directly from the Console with the results displayed in your web browser\n\nRSiteSearch(\"regression\")\n\n\n2.5.2 Other sources of help\nThere really has never been a better time to start learning R. There are a plethora of freely available online resources ranging from whole courses to subject specific tutorials and mailing lists. There are also plenty of paid for options if that’s your thing but unless you’ve money to burn there really is no need to part with your hard earned cash. Some resources we have found helpful are listed below.\nGeneral R resources\n\n\nR-Project: User contributed documentation\n\nThe R Journal: Journal of the R project for statistical computing\n\nSwirl: An R package that teaches you R from within R\nRStudio’s printable cheatsheets\n\nRseek A custom Google search for R-related sites\n\nGetting help\n\nGoogle it!: Try Googling any error messages you get. It’s not cheating and everyone does it! You’ll be surprised how many other people have probably had the same problem and solved it.\nStack Overflow: There are many thousands of questions relevant to R on Stack Overflow. Here are the most popular ones, ranked by vote. Make sure you search for similar questions before asking your own, and make sure you include a reproducible example to get the most useful advice. A reproducible example is a minimal example that lets others who are trying to help you to see the error themselves.\n\nR markdown resources\n\nBasic markdown and R markdown reference\nA good markdown reference\nA good 10-minute markdown tutorial\nRStudio’s R markdown cheatsheet\nR markdown reference sheet\n\nThe R markdown documentation including a getting started guide, a gallery of demos, and several articles for more advanced usage.\n\nThe knitr website has lots of useful reference material about how knitr works.\n\nGit and GitHub resources\n\n\nHappy Git: Great resource for using Git and GitHub\n\nVersion control with RStudio: RStudio document for using version control\n\nUsing Git from RStudio: Good 10 minute guide\n\nThe R Class: In depth guide to using Git and GitHub with RStudio\n\nR programming\n\n\nR Programming for Data Science: In depth guide to R programming\n\nR for Data Science: Fantastic book, tidyverse orientated",

    "text": "2.6 Saving stuff in R\nYour approach to saving work in R and RStudio depends on what you want to save. Most of the time the only thing you will need to save is the R code in your script(s). Remember your script is a reproducible record of everything you’ve done so all you need to do is open up your script in a new RStudio session and source it into the R Console and you’re back to where you left off.\nUnless you’ve followed our suggestion about changing the default settings for RStudio Projects you will be asked whether you want to save your workspace image every time you exit RStudio. We suggest that 99.9% of the time that you don’t want do this. By starting with a clean RStudio session each time we come back to our analysis we can be sure to avoid any potential conflicts with things we’ve done in previous sessions.\nThere are, however, some occasions when saving objects you’ve created in R is useful. For example, let’s say you’re creating an object that takes hours (even days) of computational time to generate. It would be extremely inconvenient to have to wait all this time each time you come back to your analysis (although we would suggest exporting this to an external file is a better solution). In this case we can save this object as an external .RData file which we can load back into RStudio the next time we want to use it. To save an object to an .RData file you can use the save() function (notice we don’t need to use the assignment operator here)\n\nsave(nameOfObject, file = \"name_of_file.RData\")\n\nor if you want to save all of the objects in your workspace into a single .RData file use the save.image() function\n\nsave.image(file = \"name_of_file.RData\")\n\nTo load your .RData file back into RStudio use the load() function\n\nload(file = \"name_of_file.RData\")",

    "text": "3.1 Data types\nUnderstanding the different types of data and how R deals with these data is important. The temptation is to glaze over and skip these technical details, but beware, this can come back to bite you somewhere unpleasant if you don’t pay attention. We’ve already seen an example of this when we tried (and failed) to add two character objects together using the + operator.\nR has six basic types of data; numeric, integer, logical, complex and character. The keen eyed among you will notice we’ve only listed five data types here, the final data type is raw which we won’t cover as it’s not useful 99.99% of the time. We also won’t cover complex numbers as we don’t have the imagination!\nR is (usually) able to automatically distinguish between different classes of data by their nature and the context in which they’re used although you should bear in mind that R can’t actually read your mind and you may have to explicitly tell R how you want to treat a data type. You can find out the type (or class) of any object using the class() function.\nnum &lt;- 2.2\nclass(num)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\nchar &lt;- \"hello\"\nclass(char)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\nlogi &lt;- TRUE\nclass(logi)\n\n[1] \"logical\"\nAlternatively, you can ask if an object is a specific class using using a logical test.

    "section": "\n3.2 Data structures",
    "text": "3.2 Data structures\nNow that you’ve been introduced to some of the most important classes of data in R, let’s have a look at some of main structures that we have for storing these data.\n\n3.2.1 Scalars and vectors\nPerhaps the simplest type of data structure is the vector. You’ve already been introduced to vectors in Chapter 2 although some of the vectors you created only contained a single value. Vectors that have a single value (length 1) are called scalars. Vectors can contain numbers, characters, factors or logicals, but the key thing to remember is that all the elements inside a vector must be of the same class. In other words, vectors can contain either numbers, characters or logicals but not mixtures of these types of data. There is one important exception to this, you can include NA (remember this is special type of logical) to denote missing data in vectors with other data types.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Matrices and arrays\nAnother useful data structure used in many disciplines such as population ecology, theoretical and applied statistics is the matrix. A matrix is simply a vector that has additional attributes called dimensions. Arrays are just multidimensional matrices. Again, matrices and arrays must contain elements all of the same data class.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA convenient way to create a matrix or an array is to use the matrix() and array() functions respectively. Below, we will create a matrix from a sequence 1 to 16 in four rows (nrow = 4) and fill the matrix row-wise (byrow = TRUE) rather than the default column-wise. When using the array() function we define the dimensions using the dim = argument, in our case 2 rows, 4 columns in 2 different matrices.\n\nmy_mat &lt;- matrix(1:16, nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)\nmy_mat\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    2    3    4\n[2,]    5    6    7    8\n[3,]    9   10   11   12\n[4,]   13   14   15   16\n\nmy_array &lt;- array(1:16, dim = c(2, 4, 2))\nmy_array\n\n, , 1\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    3    5    7\n[2,]    2    4    6    8\n\n, , 2\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    9   11   13   15\n[2,]   10   12   14   16\n\n\nSometimes it’s also useful to define row and column names for your matrix but this is not a requirement. To do this use the rownames() and colnames() functions.\n\nrownames(my_mat) &lt;- c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\")\ncolnames(my_mat) &lt;- c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\")\nmy_mat\n\n   a  b  c  d\nA  1  2  3  4\nB  5  6  7  8\nC  9 10 11 12\nD 13 14 15 16\n\n\nOnce you’ve created your matrices you can do useful stuff with them and as you’d expect, R has numerous built in functions to perform matrix operations. Some of the most common are given below. For example, to transpose a matrix we use the transposition function t()\n\nmy_mat_t &lt;- t(my_mat)\nmy_mat_t\n\n  A B  C  D\na 1 5  9 13\nb 2 6 10 14\nc 3 7 11 15\nd 4 8 12 16\n\n\nTo extract the diagonal elements of a matrix and store them as a vector we can use the diag() function\n\nmy_mat_diag &lt;- diag(my_mat)\nmy_mat_diag\n\n[1]  1  6 11 16\n\n\nThe usual matrix addition, multiplication etc can be performed. Note the use of the %*% operator to perform matrix multiplication.\n\nmat.1 &lt;- matrix(c(2, 0, 1, 1), nrow = 2)    # notice that the matrix has been filled \nmat.1                                     # column-wise by default\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    1\n[2,]    0    1\n\nmat.2 &lt;- matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 2), nrow = 2)\nmat.2\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    0\n[2,]    1    2\n\nmat.1 + mat.2           # matrix addition\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    3    1\n[2,]    1    3\n\nmat.1 * mat.2           # element by element products\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    2    0\n[2,]    0    2\n\nmat.1 %*% mat.2         # matrix multiplication\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    3    2\n[2,]    1    2\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Lists\nThe next data structure we will quickly take a look at is a list. Whilst vectors and matrices are constrained to contain data of the same type, lists are able to store mixtures of data types. In fact we can even store other data structures such as vectors and arrays within a list or even have a list of a list. This makes for a very flexible data structure which is ideal for storing irregular or non-rectangular data (see Chapter 7 for an example).\nTo create a list we can use the list() function. Note how each of the three list elements are of different classes (character, logical, and numeric) and are of different lengths.\n\nlist_1 &lt;- list(c(\"black\", \"yellow\", \"orange\"),\n               c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),\n               matrix(1:6, nrow = 3))\nlist_1\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"black\"  \"yellow\" \"orange\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n[[3]]\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    4\n[2,]    2    5\n[3,]    3    6\n\n\nElements of the list can be named during the construction of the list\n\nlist_2 &lt;- list(colours = c(\"black\", \"yellow\", \"orange\"), \n               evaluation = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE), \n               time = matrix(1:6, nrow = 3))\nlist_2\n\n$colours\n[1] \"black\"  \"yellow\" \"orange\"\n\n$evaluation\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n$time\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    4\n[2,]    2    5\n[3,]    3    6\n\n\nor after the list has been created using the names() function\n\nnames(list_1) &lt;- c(\"colours\", \"evaluation\", \"time\")\nlist_1\n\n$colours\n[1] \"black\"  \"yellow\" \"orange\"\n\n$evaluation\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n$time\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    4\n[2,]    2    5\n[3,]    3    6\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Data frames\nBy far the most commonly used data structure to store data in is the data frame. A data frame is a powerful two-dimensional object made up of rows and columns which looks superficially very similar to a matrix. However, whilst matrices are restricted to containing data all of the same type, data frames can contain a mixture of different types of data. Typically, in a data frame each row corresponds to an individual observation and each column corresponds to a different measured or recorded variable. This setup may be familiar to those of you who use LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel to manage and store your data. Perhaps a useful way to think about data frames is that they are essentially made up of a bunch of vectors (columns) with each vector containing its own data type but the data type can be different between vectors.\nAs an example, the data frame below contains the results of an experiment to determine the effect of removing the tip of petunia plants (Petunia sp.) grown at 3 levels of nitrogen on various measures of growth (note: data shown below are a subset of the full dataset). The data frame has 8 variables (columns) and each row represents an individual plant. The variables treat and nitrogen are factors (categorical variables). The treat variable has 2 levels (tip and notip) and the nitrogen level variable has 3 levels (low, medium and high). The variables height, weight, leafarea and shootarea are numeric and the variable flowers is an integer representing the number of flowers. Although the variable block has numeric values, these do not really have any order and could also be treated as a factor (i.e. they could also have been called A and B).\n \n\n\n\n\ntreat\nnitrogen\nblock\nheight\nweight\nleafarea\nshootarea\nflowers\n\n\n\ntip\nmedium\n1\n7.5\n7.62\n11.7\n31.9\n1\n\n\ntip\nmedium\n1\n10.7\n12.14\n14.1\n46.0\n10\n\n\ntip\nmedium\n1\n11.2\n12.76\n7.1\n66.7\n10\n\n\ntip\nmedium\n1\n10.4\n8.78\n11.9\n20.3\n1\n\n\ntip\nmedium\n1\n10.4\n13.58\n14.5\n26.9\n4\n\n\ntip\nmedium\n1\n9.8\n10.08\n12.2\n72.7\n9\n\n\nnotip\nlow\n2\n3.7\n8.10\n10.5\n60.5\n6\n\n\nnotip\nlow\n2\n3.2\n7.45\n14.1\n38.1\n4\n\n\nnotip\nlow\n2\n3.9\n9.19\n12.4\n52.6\n9\n\n\nnotip\nlow\n2\n3.3\n8.92\n11.6\n55.2\n6\n\n\nnotip\nlow\n2\n5.5\n8.44\n13.5\n77.6\n9\n\n\nnotip\nlow\n2\n4.4\n10.60\n16.2\n63.3\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThere are a couple of important things to bear in mind about data frames. These types of objects are known as rectangular data (or tidy data) as each column must have the same number of observations. Also, any missing data should be recorded as an NA just as we did with our vectors.\nWe can construct a data frame from existing data objects such as vectors using the data.frame() function. As an example, let’s create three vectors p.height, p.weight and p.names and include all of these vectors in a data frame object called dataf.\n\np.height &lt;- c(180, 155, 160, 167, 181)\np.weight &lt;- c(65, 50, 52, 58, 70)\np.names &lt;- c(\"Joanna\", \"Charlotte\", \"Helen\", \"Karen\", \"Amy\")\n\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(height = p.height, weight = p.weight, names = p.names)\ndataf\n\n  height weight     names\n1    180     65    Joanna\n2    155     50 Charlotte\n3    160     52     Helen\n4    167     58     Karen\n5    181     70       Amy\n\n\nYou’ll notice that each of the columns are named with variable name we supplied when we used the data.frame() function. It also looks like the first column of the data frame is a series of numbers from one to five. Actually, this is not really a column but the name of each row. We can check this out by getting R to return the dimensions of the dataf object using the dim() function. We see that there are 5 rows and 3 columns.\n\ndim(dataf)   # 5 rows and 3 columns\n\n[1] 5 3\n\n\nAnother really useful function which we use all the time is str() which will return a compact summary of the structure of the data frame object (or any object for that matter).\n\nstr(dataf)   \n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ height: num  180 155 160 167 181\n $ weight: num  65 50 52 58 70\n $ names : chr  \"Joanna\" \"Charlotte\" \"Helen\" \"Karen\" ...\n\n\nThe str() function gives us the data frame dimensions and also reminds us that dataf is a data.frame type object. It also lists all of the variables (columns) contained in the data frame, tells us what type of data the variables contain and prints out the first five values. We often copy this summary and place it in our R scripts with comments at the beginning of each line so we can easily refer back to it whilst writing our code. We showed you how to comment blocks in RStudio here.\nAlso notice that R has automatically decided that our p.names variable should be a character (chr) class variable when we first created the data frame. Whether this is a good idea or not will depend on how you want to use this variable in later analysis. If we decide that this wasn’t such a good idea we can change the default behaviour of the data.frame() function by including the argument stringsAsFactors = TRUE. Now our strings are automatically converted to factors.\n\np.height &lt;- c(180, 155, 160, 167, 181)\np.weight &lt;- c(65, 50, 52, 58, 70)\np.names &lt;- c(\"Joanna\", \"Charlotte\", \"Helen\", \"Karen\", \"Amy\")\n\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(height = p.height, weight = p.weight, names = p.names, \n                                        stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\nstr(dataf)\n\n'data.frame':   5 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ height: num  180 155 160 167 181\n $ weight: num  65 50 52 58 70\n $ names : Factor w/ 5 levels \"Amy\",\"Charlotte\",..: 4 2 3 5 1",

    "section": "\n3.3 Importing data",
    "text": "3.3 Importing data\nAlthough creating data frames from existing data structures is extremely useful, by far the most common approach is to create a data frame by importing data from an external file. To do this, you’ll need to have your data correctly formatted and saved in a file format that R is able to recognise. Fortunately for us, R is able to recognise a wide variety of file formats, although in reality you’ll probably end up only using two or three regularly.\n\n3.3.1 Saving files to import\nThe easiest method of creating a data file to import into R is to enter your data into a spreadsheet using either Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc and save the spreadsheet as a tab delimited file. We prefer LibreOffice Calc as it’s open source, platform independent and free but MS Excel is OK too (but see here for some gotchas). Here’s the data from the petunia experiment we dicussed previously displayed in LibreOffice. If you want to follow along you can download the data file (‘flower.xls’) from the companion website here.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFor those of you unfamiliar with the tab delimited file format it simply means that data in different columns are separated with a ‘tab’ character (yes, the same one as on your keyboard) and is usually saved as a file with a ‘.txt’ extension (you might also see .tsv which is short for tab separated values).\nTo save a spreadsheet as a tab delimited file in LibreOffice Calc select File -&gt; Save as ... from the main menu. You will need to specify the location you want to save your file in the ‘Save in folder’ option and the name of the file in the ‘Name’ option. In the drop down menu located above the ‘Save’ button change the default ‘All formats’ to ‘Text CSV (.csv)’.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nClick the Save button and then select the ‘Use Text CSV Format’ option. In the next pop-up window select {Tab} from the drop down menu in the ‘Field delimiter’ option. Click on OK to save the file.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe resulting file will annoyingly have a ‘.csv’ extension even though we’ve saved it as a tab delimited file. Either live with it or rename the file with a ‘.txt’ extension instead.\nIn MS Excel, select File -&gt; Save as ... from the main menu and navigate to the folder where you want to save the file. Enter the file name (keep it fairly short, no spaces!) in the ‘Save as:’ dialogue box. In the ‘File format:’ dialogue box click on the down arrow to open the drop down menu and select ‘Text (Tab delimited)’ as your file type. Select OK to save the file.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThere are a couple of things to bear in mind when saving files to import into R which will make your life easier in the long run. Keep your column headings (if you have them) short and informative. Also avoid spaces in your column headings by replacing them with an underscore or a dot (i.e. replace shoot height with shoot_height or shoot.height) and avoid using special characters (i.e. leaf area (mm^2)). Remember, if you have missing data in your data frame (empty cells) you should use an NA to represent these missing values. This will keep the data frame tidy.\n\n3.3.2 Import functions\nOnce you’ve saved your data file in a suitable format we can now read this file into R. The workhorse function for importing data into R is the read.table() function (we discuss some alternatives later in the chapter). The read.table() function is a very flexible function with a shed load of arguments (see ?read.table) but it’s quite simple to use. Let’s import a tab delimited file called flower.txt which contains the data we saw previously in this Chapter and assign it to an object called flowers. The file is located in a data directory which itself is located in our root directory. The first row of the data contains the variable (column) names. To use the read.table() function to import this file\n\nflowers &lt;- read.table(file = 'data/flower.txt', header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\",\n                        stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\nThere are a few things to note about the above command. First, the file path and the filename (including the file extension) needs to be enclosed in either single or double quotes (i.e. the data/flower.txt bit) as the read.table() function expects this to be a character string. If your working directory is already set to the directory which contains the file, you don’t need to include the entire file path just the filename. In the example above, the file path is separated with a single forward slash /. This will work regardless of the operating system you are using and we recommend you stick with this. However, Windows users may be more familiar with the single backslash notation and if you want to keep using this you will need to include them as double backslashes. Note though that the double backslash notation will not work on computers using Mac OSX or Linux operating systems.\n\nflowers &lt;- read.table(file = 'C:\\\\Documents\\\\Prog1\\\\data\\\\flower.txt', \n                      header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\n\nThe header = TRUE argument specifies that the first row of your data contains the variable names (i.e. nitrogen, block etc). If this is not the case you can specify header = FALSE (actually, this is the default value so you can omit this argument entirely). The sep = \"\\t\" argument tells R that the file delimiter is a tab (\\t).\nAfter importing our data into R it doesn’t appear that R has done much, at least nothing appears in the R Console! To see the contents of the data frame we could just type the name of the object as we have done previously. BUT before you do that, think about why you’re doing this. If your data frame is anything other than tiny, all you’re going to do is fill up your Console with data. It’s not like you can easily check whether there are any errors or that your data has been imported correctly. A much better solution is to use our old friend the str() function to return a compact and informative summary of your data frame.\n\nstr(flowers) \n\n'data.frame':   96 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ treat    : Factor w/ 2 levels \"notip\",\"tip\": 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ nitrogen : Factor w/ 3 levels \"high\",\"low\",\"medium\": 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ block    : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...\n $ height   : num  7.5 10.7 11.2 10.4 10.4 9.8 6.9 9.4 10.4 12.3 ...\n $ weight   : num  7.62 12.14 12.76 8.78 13.58 ...\n $ leafarea : num  11.7 14.1 7.1 11.9 14.5 12.2 13.2 14 10.5 16.1 ...\n $ shootarea: num  31.9 46 66.7 20.3 26.9 72.7 43.1 28.5 57.8 36.9 ...\n $ flowers  : int  1 10 10 1 4 9 7 6 5 8 ...\n\n\nHere we see that flowers is a ‘data.frame’ object which contains 96 rows and 8 variables (columns). Each of the variables are listed along with their data class and the first 10 values. As we mentioned previously in this Chapter, it can be quite convenient to copy and paste this into your R script as a comment block for later reference.\nNotice also that your character string variables (treat and nitrogen) have been imported as factors because we used the argument stringsAsFactors = TRUE. If this is not what you want you can prevent this by using the stringsAsFactors = FALSE or from R version 4.0.0 you can just leave out this argument as stringsAsFactors = FALSE is the default.\n\nflowers &lt;- read.table(file = 'data/flower.txt', header = TRUE, \n                      sep = \"\\t\", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\nstr(flowers) \n\n'data.frame':   96 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ treat    : chr  \"tip\" \"tip\" \"tip\" \"tip\" ...\n $ nitrogen : chr  \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" ...\n $ block    : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...\n $ height   : num  7.5 10.7 11.2 10.4 10.4 9.8 6.9 9.4 10.4 12.3 ...\n $ weight   : num  7.62 12.14 12.76 8.78 13.58 ...\n $ leafarea : num  11.7 14.1 7.1 11.9 14.5 12.2 13.2 14 10.5 16.1 ...\n $ shootarea: num  31.9 46 66.7 20.3 26.9 72.7 43.1 28.5 57.8 36.9 ...\n $ flowers  : int  1 10 10 1 4 9 7 6 5 8 ...\n\n\nOther useful arguments include dec = and na.strings =. The dec = argument allows you to change the default character (.) used for a decimal point. This is useful if you’re in a country where decimal places are usually represented by a comma (i.e. dec = \",\"). The na.strings = argument allows you to import data where missing values are represented with a symbol other than NA. This can be quite common if you are importing data from other statistical software such as Minitab which represents missing values as a * (na.strings = \"*\").\nIf we just wanted to see the names of our variables (columns) in the data frame we can use the names() function which will return a character vector of the variable names.\n\nnames(flowers)\n\n[1] \"treat\"     \"nitrogen\"  \"block\"     \"height\"    \"weight\"    \"leafarea\" \n[7] \"shootarea\" \"flowers\"  \n\n\nR has a number of variants of the read.table() function that you can use to import a variety of file formats. Actually, these variants just use the read.table() function but include different combinations of arguments by default to help import different file types. The most useful of these are the read.csv(), read.csv2() and read.delim() functions. The read.csv() function is used to import comma separated value (.csv) files and assumes that the data in columns are separated by a comma (it sets sep = \",\" by default). It also assumes that the first row of the data contains the variable names by default (it sets header = TRUE by default). The read.csv2() function assumes data are separated by semicolons and that a comma is used instead of a decimal point (as in many European countries). The read.delim() function is used to import tab delimited data and also assumes that the first row of the data contains the variable names by default.\n\n# import .csv file\nflowers &lt;- read.csv(file = 'data/flower.csv') \n\n# import .csv file with dec = \",\" and sep = \";\"\nflowers &lt;- read.csv2(file = 'data/flower.csv') \n\n# import tab delim file with sep = \"\\t\"\nflowers &lt;- read.delim(file = 'data/flower.txt') \n\nYou can even import spreadsheet files from MS Excel or other statistics software directly into R but our advice is that this should generally be avoided if possible as it just adds a layer of uncertainty between you and your data. In our opinion it’s almost always better to export your spreadsheets as tab or comma delimited files and then import them into R using the read.table() function. If you’re hell bent on directly importing data from other software you will need to install the foreign package which has functions for importing Minitab, SPSS, Stata and SAS files or the xlsx package to import Excel spreadsheets.\n\n3.3.3 Common import frustrations\nIt’s quite common to get a bunch of really frustrating error messages when you first start importing data into R. Perhaps the most common is\nError in file(file, \"rt\") : cannot open the connection\nIn addition: Warning message:\nIn file(file, \"rt\") :\n  cannot open file 'flower.txt': No such file or directory\nThis error message is telling you that R cannot find the file you are trying to import. It usually rears its head for one of a couple of reasons (or all of them!). The first is that you’ve made a mistake in the spelling of either the filename or file path. Another common mistake is that you have forgotten to include the file extension in the filename (i.e. .txt). Lastly, the file is not where you say it is or you’ve used an incorrect file path. Using RStudio Projects and having a logical directory structure goes a long way to avoiding these types of errors.\nAnother really common mistake is to forget to include the header = TRUE argument when the first row of the data contains variable names. For example, if we omit this argument when we import our flowers.txt file everything looks OK at first (no error message at least)\n\nflowers_bad &lt;- read.table(file = 'data/flower.txt', sep = \"\\t\")\n\nbut when we take a look at our data frame using str()\n\nstr(flowers_bad)\n\n'data.frame':   97 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ V1: chr  \"treat\" \"tip\" \"tip\" \"tip\" ...\n $ V2: chr  \"nitrogen\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" ...\n $ V3: chr  \"block\" \"1\" \"1\" \"1\" ...\n $ V4: chr  \"height\" \"7.5\" \"10.7\" \"11.2\" ...\n $ V5: chr  \"weight\" \"7.62\" \"12.14\" \"12.76\" ...\n $ V6: chr  \"leafarea\" \"11.7\" \"14.1\" \"7.1\" ...\n $ V7: chr  \"shootarea\" \"31.9\" \"46\" \"66.7\" ...\n $ V8: chr  \"flowers\" \"1\" \"10\" \"10\" ...\n\n\nWe can see an obvious problem, all of our variables have been imported as factors and our variables are named V1, V2, V3 … V8. The problem happens because we haven’t told the read.table() function that the first row contains the variable names and so it treats them as data. As soon as we have a single character string in any of our data vectors, R treats the vectors as character type data (remember all elements in a vector must contain the same type of data).\n\n3.3.4 Other import options\nThere are numerous other functions to import data from a variety of sources and formats. Most of these functions are contained in packages that you will need to install before using them. We list a couple of the more useful packages and functions below.\nThe fread() function from the read.table package is great for importing large data files quickly and efficiently (much faster than the read.table() function). One of the great things about the fread() function is that it will automatically detect many of the arguments you would normally need to specify (like sep = etc). One of the things you will need to consider though is that the fread() function will return a data.table object not a data.frame as would be the case with the read.table() function. This is usually not a problem as you can pass a data.table object to any function that only accepts data.frame objects. To learn more about the differences between data.table and data.frame objects see here.\n\nlibrary(read.table)\nall_data &lt;- fread(file = 'data/flower.txt')\n\nVarious functions from the readr package are also very efficient at reading in large data files. The readr package is part of the ‘tidyverse’ collection of packages and provides many equivalent functions to base R for importing data. The readr functions are used in a similar way to the read.table() or read.csv() functions and many of the arguments are the same (see ?readr::read_table for more details). There are however some differences. For example, when using the read_table() function the header = TRUE argument is replaced by col_names = TRUE and the function returns a tibble class object which is the tidyverse equivalent of a data.frame object (see here for differences). \n\nlibrary(readr)\n# import white space delimited files\nall_data &lt;- read_table(file = 'data/flower.txt', col_names = TRUE)\n\n# import comma delimited files\nall_data &lt;- read_csv(file = 'data/flower.txt')\n\n# import tab delimited files\nall_data &lt;- read_delim(file = 'data/flower.txt', delim = \"\\t\")\n\n# or use\nall_data &lt;- read_tsv(file = 'data/flower.txt')\n\nIf your data file is ginormous, then the ff and bigmemory packages may be useful as they both contain import functions that are able to store large data in a memory efficient manner. You can find out more about these functions here and here.",

    "text": "3.4 Wrangling data frames\nNow that you’re able to successfully import your data from an external file into R our next task is to do something useful with our data. Working with data is a fundamental skill which you’ll need to develop and get comfortable with as you’ll likely do a lot of it during any project. The good news is that R is especially good at manipulating, summarising and visualising data. Manipulating data (often known as data wrangling or munging) in R can at first seem a little daunting for the new user but if you follow a few simple logical rules then you’ll quickly get the hang of it, especially with some practice.\nLet’s remind ourselves of the structure of the flowers data frame we imported in the previous section.\n\nflowers &lt;- read.table(file = 'data/flower.txt', header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\")\nstr(flowers)\n\n'data.frame':   96 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ treat    : chr  \"tip\" \"tip\" \"tip\" \"tip\" ...\n $ nitrogen : chr  \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" ...\n $ block    : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...\n $ height   : num  7.5 10.7 11.2 10.4 10.4 9.8 6.9 9.4 10.4 12.3 ...\n $ weight   : num  7.62 12.14 12.76 8.78 13.58 ...\n $ leafarea : num  11.7 14.1 7.1 11.9 14.5 12.2 13.2 14 10.5 16.1 ...\n $ shootarea: num  31.9 46 66.7 20.3 26.9 72.7 43.1 28.5 57.8 36.9 ...\n $ flowers  : int  1 10 10 1 4 9 7 6 5 8 ...\n\n\nTo access the data in any of the variables (columns) in our data frame we can use the $ notation. For example, to access the height variable in our flowers data frame we can use flowers$height. This tells R that the height variable is contained within the data frame flowers.\n\nflowers$height\n\n [1]  7.5 10.7 11.2 10.4 10.4  9.8  6.9  9.4 10.4 12.3 10.4 11.0  7.1  6.0  9.0\n[16]  4.5 12.6 10.0 10.0  8.5 14.1 10.1  8.5  6.5 11.5  7.7  6.4  8.8  9.2  6.2\n[31]  6.3 17.2  8.0  8.0  6.4  7.6  9.7 12.3  9.1  8.9  7.4  3.1  7.9  8.8  8.5\n[46]  5.6 11.5  5.8  5.6  5.3  7.5  4.1  3.5  8.5  4.9  2.5  5.4  3.9  5.8  4.5\n[61]  8.0  1.8  2.2  3.9  8.5  8.5  6.4  1.2  2.6 10.9  7.2  2.1  4.7  5.0  6.5\n[76]  2.6  6.0  9.3  4.6  5.2  3.9  2.3  5.2  2.2  4.5  1.8  3.0  3.7  2.4  5.7\n[91]  3.7  3.2  3.9  3.3  5.5  4.4\n\n\nThis will return a vector of the height data. If we want we can assign this vector to another object and do stuff with it, like calculate a mean or get a summary of the variable using the summary() function.\n\nf_height &lt;- flowers$height\nmean(f_height)\n\n[1] 6.839583\n\nsummary(f_height)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  1.200   4.475   6.450   6.840   9.025  17.200 \n\n\nJust as we did with vectors, we also can access data in data frames using the square bracket [ ] notation. However, instead of just using a single index, we now need to use two indexes, one to specify the rows and one for the columns. To do this, we can use the notation my_data[rows, columns] where rows and columns are indexes and my_data is the name of the data frame. Again, just like with our vectors our indexes can be positional or the result of a logical test.\n\n3.4.1 Positional indexes\nTo use positional indexes we simple have to write the position of the rows and columns we want to extract inside the [ ]. For example, if for some reason we wanted to extract the first value (1st row ) of the height variable (4th column)\n\nflowers[1, 4]\n\n[1] 7.5\n\n# this would give you the same\nflowers$height[1]\n\n[1] 7.5\n\n\nWe can also extract values from multiple rows or columns by specifying these indexes as vectors inside the [ ]. To extract the first 10 rows and the first 4 columns we simple supply a vector containing a sequence from 1 to 10 for the rows index (1:10) and a vector from 1 to 4 for the column index (1:4).\n\nflowers[1:10, 1:4]\n\n   treat nitrogen block height\n1    tip   medium     1    7.5\n2    tip   medium     1   10.7\n3    tip   medium     1   11.2\n4    tip   medium     1   10.4\n5    tip   medium     1   10.4\n6    tip   medium     1    9.8\n7    tip   medium     1    6.9\n8    tip   medium     1    9.4\n9    tip   medium     2   10.4\n10   tip   medium     2   12.3\n\n\nOr for non sequential rows and columns then we can supply vectors of positions using the c() function. To extract the 1st, 5th, 12th, 30th rows from the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 8th columns\n\nflowers[c(1, 5, 12, 30), c(1, 3, 6, 8)]\n\n   treat block leafarea flowers\n1    tip     1     11.7       1\n5    tip     1     14.5       4\n12   tip     2     12.6       6\n30   tip     2     11.6       5\n\n\nAll we are doing in the two examples above is creating vectors of positions for the rows and columns that we want to extract. We have done this by using the skills we developed in Chapter 2 when we generated vectors using the c() function or using the : notation.\nBut what if we want to extract either all of the rows or all of the columns? It would be extremely tedious to have to generate vectors for all rows or for all columns. Thankfully R has a shortcut. If you don’t specify either a row or column index in the [ ] then R interprets it to mean you want all rows or all columns. For example, to extract the first 8 rows and all of the columns in the flower data frame\n\nflowers[1:8, ]\n\n  treat nitrogen block height weight leafarea shootarea flowers\n1   tip   medium     1    7.5   7.62     11.7      31.9       1\n2   tip   medium     1   10.7  12.14     14.1      46.0      10\n3   tip   medium     1   11.2  12.76      7.1      66.7      10\n4   tip   medium     1   10.4   8.78     11.9      20.3       1\n5   tip   medium     1   10.4  13.58     14.5      26.9       4\n6   tip   medium     1    9.8  10.08     12.2      72.7       9\n7   tip   medium     1    6.9  10.11     13.2      43.1       7\n8   tip   medium     1    9.4  10.28     14.0      28.5       6\n\n\nor all of the rows and the first 3 columns.

As an example, lets extract all of the rows except the first 85 rows and all columns except the 4th, 7th and 8th columns. Notice we need to use -() when we generate our row positional vectors. If we had just used -1:85 this would actually generate a regular sequence from -1 to 85 which is not what we want (we can of course use -1:-85).\n\nflowers[-(1:85), -c(4, 7, 8)]\n\n   treat nitrogen block weight leafarea\n86 notip      low     1   6.01     17.6\n87 notip      low     1   9.93     12.0\n88 notip      low     1   7.03      7.9\n89 notip      low     2   9.10     14.5\n90 notip      low     2   9.05      9.6\n91 notip      low     2   8.10     10.5\n92 notip      low     2   7.45     14.1\n93 notip      low     2   9.19     12.4\n94 notip      low     2   8.92     11.6\n95 notip      low     2   8.44     13.5\n96 notip      low     2  10.60     16.2\n\n\nIn addition to using a positional index for extracting particular columns (variables) we can also name the variables directly when using the square bracket [ ] notation. For example, let’s extract the first 5 rows and the variables treat, nitrogen and leafarea. Instead of using flowers[1:5, c(1, 2, 6)] we can instead use\n\nflowers[1:5, c(\"treat\", \"nitrogen\", \"leafarea\")]\n\n  treat nitrogen leafarea\n1   tip   medium     11.7\n2   tip   medium     14.1\n3   tip   medium      7.1\n4   tip   medium     11.9\n5   tip   medium     14.5\n\n\nWe often use this method in preference to the positional index for selecting columns as it will still give us what we want even if we’ve changed the order of the columns in our data frame for some reason.\n\n3.4.2 Logical indexes\nJust as we did with vectors, we can also extract data from our data frame based on a logical test. We can use all of the logical operators that we used for our vector examples so if these have slipped your mind maybe pop back and refresh your memory. Let’s extract all rows where height is greater than 12 and extract all columns by default (remember, if you don’t include a column index after the comma it means all columns).\n\nbig_flowers &lt;- flowers[flowers$height &gt; 12, ]\nbig_flowers\n\n   treat nitrogen block height weight leafarea shootarea flowers\n10   tip   medium     2   12.3  13.48     16.1      36.9       8\n17   tip     high     1   12.6  18.66     18.6      54.0       9\n21   tip     high     1   14.1  19.12     13.1     113.2      13\n32   tip     high     2   17.2  19.20     10.9      89.9      14\n38   tip      low     1   12.3  11.27     13.7      28.7       5\n\n\nNotice in the code above that we need to use the flowers$height notation for the logical test. If we just named the height variable without the name of the data frame we would receive an error telling us R couldn’t find the variable height. The reason for this is that the height variable only exists inside the flowers data frame so you need to tell R exactly where it is.\nbig_flowers &lt;- flowers[height &gt; 12, ]\nError in `[.data.frame`(flowers, height &gt; 12, ) : \n  object 'height' not found\nSo how does this work? The logical test is flowers$height &gt; 12 and R will only extract those rows that satisfy this logical condition. If we look at the output of just the logical condition you can see this returns a vector containing TRUE if height is greater than 12 and FALSE if height is not greater than 12.\n\nflowers$height &gt; 12\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n[13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[37] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[49] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[61] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[73] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n[85] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n\n\nSo our row index is a vector containing either TRUE or FALSE values and only those rows that are TRUE are selected.\nOther commonly used operators are shown below\n\nflowers[flowers$height &gt;= 6, ]        # values greater or equal to 6\n\nflowers[flowers$height &lt;= 6, ]          # values less than or equal to 6\n\nflowers[flowers$height == 8, ]         # values  equal to 8\n\nflowers[flowers$height != 8, ]         # values  not equal to 8\n\nWe can also extract rows based on the value of a character string or factor level. Let’s extract all rows where the nitrogen level is equal to high (again we will output all columns). Notice that the double equals == sign must be used for a logical test and that the character string must be enclosed in either single or double quotes (i.e. \"high\").\n\nnit_high &lt;- flowers[flowers$nitrogen == \"high\", ]        \nnit_high\n\n\n\n   treat nitrogen block height weight leafarea shootarea flowers\n17   tip     high     1   12.6  18.66     18.6      54.0       9\n18   tip     high     1   10.0  18.07     16.9      90.5       3\n19   tip     high     1   10.0  13.29     15.8     142.7      12\n20   tip     high     1    8.5  14.33     13.2      91.4       5\n21   tip     high     1   14.1  19.12     13.1     113.2      13\n22   tip     high     1   10.1  15.49     12.6      77.2      12\n23   tip     high     1    8.5  17.82     20.5      54.4       3\n24   tip     high     1    6.5  17.13     24.1     147.4       6\n25   tip     high     2   11.5  23.89     14.3     101.5      12\n26   tip     high     2    7.7  14.77     17.2     104.5       4\n27   tip     high     2    6.4  13.60     13.6     152.6       7\n28   tip     high     2    8.8  16.58     16.7     100.1       9\n29   tip     high     2    9.2  13.26     11.3     108.0       9\n30   tip     high     2    6.2  17.32     11.6      85.9       5\n31   tip     high     2    6.3  14.50     18.3      55.6       8\n32   tip     high     2   17.2  19.20     10.9      89.9      14\n65 notip     high     1    8.5  22.53     20.8     166.9      16\n66 notip     high     1    8.5  17.33     19.8     184.4      12\n67 notip     high     1    6.4  11.52     12.1     140.5       7\n68 notip     high     1    1.2  18.24     16.6     148.1       7\n69 notip     high     1    2.6  16.57     17.1     141.1       3\n70 notip     high     1   10.9  17.22     49.2     189.6      17\n71 notip     high     1    7.2  15.21     15.9     135.0      14\n72 notip     high     1    2.1  19.15     15.6     176.7       6\n73 notip     high     2    4.7  13.42     19.8     124.7       5\n74 notip     high     2    5.0  16.82     17.3     182.5      15\n75 notip     high     2    6.5  14.00     10.1     126.5       7\n76 notip     high     2    2.6  18.88     16.4     181.5      14\n77 notip     high     2    6.0  13.68     16.2     133.7       2\n78 notip     high     2    9.3  18.75     18.4     181.1      16\n79 notip     high     2    4.6  14.65     16.7      91.7      11\n80 notip     high     2    5.2  17.70     19.1     181.1       8\n\n\nOr we can extract all rows where nitrogen level is not equal to medium (using !=) and only return columns 1 to 4.\n\nnit_not_medium &lt;- flowers[flowers$nitrogen != \"medium\", 1:4]        \nnit_not_medium\n\n\n\n   treat nitrogen block height\n17   tip     high     1   12.6\n18   tip     high     1   10.0\n19   tip     high     1   10.0\n20   tip     high     1    8.5\n21   tip     high     1   14.1\n22   tip     high     1   10.1\n23   tip     high     1    8.5\n24   tip     high     1    6.5\n25   tip     high     2   11.5\n26   tip     high     2    7.7\n27   tip     high     2    6.4\n28   tip     high     2    8.8\n29   tip     high     2    9.2\n30   tip     high     2    6.2\n31   tip     high     2    6.3\n32   tip     high     2   17.2\n33   tip      low     1    8.0\n34   tip      low     1    8.0\n35   tip      low     1    6.4\n36   tip      low     1    7.6\n37   tip      low     1    9.7\n38   tip      low     1   12.3\n39   tip      low     1    9.1\n40   tip      low     1    8.9\n41   tip      low     2    7.4\n42   tip      low     2    3.1\n43   tip      low     2    7.9\n44   tip      low     2    8.8\n45   tip      low     2    8.5\n46   tip      low     2    5.6\n47   tip      low     2   11.5\n48   tip      low     2    5.8\n65 notip     high     1    8.5\n66 notip     high     1    8.5\n67 notip     high     1    6.4\n68 notip     high     1    1.2\n69 notip     high     1    2.6\n70 notip     high     1   10.9\n71 notip     high     1    7.2\n72 notip     high     1    2.1\n73 notip     high     2    4.7\n74 notip     high     2    5.0\n75 notip     high     2    6.5\n76 notip     high     2    2.6\n77 notip     high     2    6.0\n78 notip     high     2    9.3\n79 notip     high     2    4.6\n80 notip     high     2    5.2\n81 notip      low     1    3.9\n82 notip      low     1    2.3\n83 notip      low     1    5.2\n84 notip      low     1    2.2\n85 notip      low     1    4.5\n86 notip      low     1    1.8\n87 notip      low     1    3.0\n88 notip      low     1    3.7\n89 notip      low     2    2.4\n90 notip      low     2    5.7\n91 notip      low     2    3.7\n92 notip      low     2    3.2\n93 notip      low     2    3.9\n94 notip      low     2    3.3\n95 notip      low     2    5.5\n96 notip      low     2    4.4\n\n\nWe can increase the complexity of our logical tests by combining them with Boolean expressions just as we did for vector objects. For example, to extract all rows where height is greater or equal to 6 AND nitrogen is equal to medium AND treat is equal to notip we combine a series of logical expressions with the & symbol.\n\nlow_notip_heigh6 &lt;- flowers[flowers$height &gt;= 6 & flowers$nitrogen == \"medium\" &\n                             flowers$treat == \"notip\", ]        \nlow_notip_heigh6\n\n   treat nitrogen block height weight leafarea shootarea flowers\n51 notip   medium     1    7.5  13.60     13.6     122.2      11\n54 notip   medium     1    8.5  10.04     12.3     113.6       4\n61 notip   medium     2    8.0  11.43     12.6      43.2      14\n\n\nTo extract rows based on an ‘OR’ Boolean expression we can use the | symbol. Let’s extract all rows where height is greater than 12.3 OR less than 2.2.\n\nheight2.2_12.3 &lt;- flowers[flowers$height &gt; 12.3 | flowers$height &lt; 2.2, ]        \nheight2.2_12.3\n\n   treat nitrogen block height weight leafarea shootarea flowers\n17   tip     high     1   12.6  18.66     18.6      54.0       9\n21   tip     high     1   14.1  19.12     13.1     113.2      13\n32   tip     high     2   17.2  19.20     10.9      89.9      14\n62 notip   medium     2    1.8  10.47     11.8     120.8       9\n68 notip     high     1    1.2  18.24     16.6     148.1       7\n72 notip     high     1    2.1  19.15     15.6     176.7       6\n86 notip      low     1    1.8   6.01     17.6      46.2       4\n\n\nAn alternative method of selecting parts of a data frame based on a logical expression is to use the subset() function instead of the [ ]. The advantage of using subset() is that you no longer need to use the $ notation when specifying variables inside the data frame as the first argument to the function is the name of the data frame to be subsetted. The disadvantage is that subset() is less flexible than the [ ] notation.\n\ntip_med_2 &lt;- subset(flowers, treat == \"tip\" & nitrogen == \"medium\" & block == 2)\ntip_med_2\n\n   treat nitrogen block height weight leafarea shootarea flowers\n9    tip   medium     2   10.4  10.48     10.5      57.8       5\n10   tip   medium     2   12.3  13.48     16.1      36.9       8\n11   tip   medium     2   10.4  13.18     11.1      56.8      12\n12   tip   medium     2   11.0  11.56     12.6      31.3       6\n13   tip   medium     2    7.1   8.16     29.6       9.7       2\n14   tip   medium     2    6.0  11.22     13.0      16.4       3\n15   tip   medium     2    9.0  10.20     10.8      90.1       6\n16   tip   medium     2    4.5  12.55     13.4      14.4       6\n\n\nAnd if you only want certain columns you can use the select = argument.\n\ntipplants &lt;- subset(flowers, treat == \"tip\" & nitrogen == \"medium\" & block == 2, \n                            select = c(\"treat\", \"nitrogen\", \"leafarea\"))\ntipplants\n\n   treat nitrogen leafarea\n9    tip   medium     10.5\n10   tip   medium     16.1\n11   tip   medium     11.1\n12   tip   medium     12.6\n13   tip   medium     29.6\n14   tip   medium     13.0\n15   tip   medium     10.8\n16   tip   medium     13.4\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Ordering data frames\nRemember when we used the function order() to order one vector based on the order of another vector (way back in Chapter 2). This comes in very handy if you want to reorder rows in your data frame. For example, if we want all of the rows in the data frame flowers to be ordered in ascending value of height and output all columns by default. If you’re reading this section of the book on the web you can scroll down in the output panels to see the entire ordered data frame. If you’re reading the pdf version of the book, note that some of the output from the code chunks has been truncated to save some space.\n\nheight_ord &lt;- flowers[order(flowers$height), ]

We can use a simple trick by adding a - symbol before the flowers$height variable when we use the order() function. This will essentially turn all of the height values negative which will result in reversing the order. Note, that this trick will only work with numeric variables.\n\nblock_revheight_ord &lt;- flowers[order(flowers$block, -flowers$height), ]        \nblock_revheight_ord\n\n\n\n   treat nitrogen block

by nitrogen but this time order it from low -&gt; medium -&gt; high instead of the default alphabetically (high, low, medium), we need to first change the order of our levels of the nitrogen factor in our data frame using the factor() function. Once we’ve done this we can then use the order() function as usual. Note, if you’re reading the pdf version of this book, the output has been truncated to save space.\n\nflowers$nitrogen &lt;- factor(flowers$nitrogen, \n                           levels = c(\"low\",

rows\nSometimes it’s useful to be able to add extra rows and columns of data to our data frames. There are multiple ways to achieve this (as there always is in R!) depending on your circumstances. To simply append additional rows to an existing data frame we can use the rbind() function and to append columns the cbind() function. Let’s create a couple of test data frames to see this in action using our old friend the data.frame() function.\n\n# rbind for rows\ndf1 &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:4, height = c(120, 150, 132, 122),\n                        weight = c(44, 56, 49, 45))\ndf1\n\n  id height weight\n1  1    120     44\n2  2    150     56\n3  3    132     49\n4  4    122     45\n\ndf2 &lt;- data.frame(id = 5:6, height = c(119, 110),\n                        weight = c(39, 35))\ndf2\n\n  id height weight\n1  5    119     39\n2  6    110     35\n\ndf3 &lt;- data.frame(id = 1:4, height = c(120, 150, 132, 122),\n                        weight = c(44, 56, 49, 45))\ndf3\n\n  id height weight\n1  1    120     44\n2  2    150     56\n3  3    132     49\n4  4    122     45\n\ndf4 &lt;- data.frame(location = c(\"UK\", \"CZ\", \"CZ\", \"UK\"))\ndf4\n\n  location\n1       UK\n2       CZ\n3       CZ\n4       UK\n\n\nWe can use the rbind() function to append the rows of data in df2 to the rows in df1 and assign the new data frame to df_rcomb.\n\ndf_rcomb &lt;- rbind(df1, df2)\ndf_rcomb\n\n  id height weight\n1  1    120     44\n2  2    150     56\n3  3    132     49\n4  4    122     45\n5  5    119     39\n6  6    110     35\n\n\nAnd cbind to append the column in df4 to the df3 data frame and assign to df_ccomb`.\n\ndf_ccomb &lt;- cbind(df3, df4)\ndf_ccomb\n\n  id height weight location\n1  1    120     44       UK\n2  2    150     56       CZ\n3  3    132     49       CZ\n4  4    122     45       UK\n\n\nAnother situation when adding a new column to a data frame is useful is when you want to perform some kind of transformation on an existing variable. For example, say we wanted to apply a log10 transformation on the height variable in the df_rcomb data frame we created above. We could just create a separate variable to contains these values but it’s good practice to create this variable as a new column inside our existing data frame so we keep all of our data together. Let’s call this new variable height_log10.\n\n# log10 transformation\ndf_rcomb$height_log10 &lt;- log10(df_rcomb$height)\ndf_rcomb\n\n  id height weight height_log10\n1  1    120     44     2.079181\n2  2    150     56     2.176091\n3  3    132     49     2.120574\n4  4    122     45     2.086360\n5  5    119     39     2.075547\n6  6    110     35     2.041393\n\n\nThis situation also crops up when we want to convert an existing variable in a data frame from one data class to another data class. For example, the id variable in the df_rcomb data frame is numeric type data (use the str() or class() functions to check for yourself). If we wanted to convert the id variable to a factor to use later in our analysis we can create a new variable called Fid in our data frame and use the factor() function to convert the id variable.\n\n# convert to a factor \ndf_rcomb$Fid &lt;- factor(df_rcomb$id)\ndf_rcomb\n\n  id height weight height_log10 Fid\n1  1    120     44     2.079181   1\n2  2    150     56     2.176091   2\n3  3    132     49     2.120574   3\n4  4    122     45     2.086360   4\n5  5    119     39     2.075547   5\n6  6    110     35     2.041393   6\n\nstr(df_rcomb)\n\n'data.frame':   6 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ id          : int  1 2 3 4 5 6\n $ height      : num  120 150 132 122 119 110\n $ weight      : num  44 56 49 45 39 35\n $ height_log10: num  2.08 2.18 2.12 2.09 2.08 ...\n $ Fid         : Factor w/ 6 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Merging data frames\nInstead of just appending either rows or columns to a data frame we can also merge two data frames together. Let’s say we have one data frame that contains taxonomic information on some common UK rocky shore invertebrates (called taxa) and another data frame that contains information on where they are usually found on the rocky shore (called zone). We can merge these two data frames together to produce a single data frame with both taxonomic and location information. Let’s first create both of these data frames (in reality you would probably just import your different datasets).\n\ntaxa &lt;- data.frame(GENUS = c(\"Patella\", \"Littorina\", \"Halichondria\", \"Semibalanus\"),\n         species = c(\"vulgata\", \"littoria\", \"panacea\", \"balanoides\"),\n         family = c(\"patellidae\", \"Littorinidae\", \"Halichondriidae\", \"Archaeobalanidae\"))\ntaxa\n\n         GENUS    species           family\n1      Patella    vulgata       patellidae\n2    Littorina   littoria     Littorinidae\n3 Halichondria    panacea  Halichondriidae\n4  Semibalanus balanoides Archaeobalanidae\n\nzone &lt;- data.frame(genus = c(\"Laminaria\", \"Halichondria\", \"Xanthoria\", \"Littorina\", \n                             \"Semibalanus\", \"Fucus\"),\n                   species = c(\"digitata\", \"panacea\", \"parietina\", \"littoria\", \n                               \"balanoides\", \"serratus\"),\n                   zone = c( \"v_low\", \"low\", \"v_high\", \"low_mid\", \"high\", \"low_mid\"))\nzone\n\n         genus    species    zone\n1    Laminaria   digitata   v_low\n2 Halichondria    panacea     low\n3    Xanthoria  parietina  v_high\n4    Littorina   littoria low_mid\n5  Semibalanus balanoides    high\n6        Fucus   serratus low_mid\n\n\nBecause both of our data frames contains at least one variable in common (species in our case) we can simply use the merge() function to create a new data frame called taxa_zone.\n\ntaxa_zone &lt;- merge(x = taxa, y = zone)\ntaxa_zone\n\n     species        GENUS           family        genus    zone\n1 balanoides  Semibalanus Archaeobalanidae  Semibalanus    high\n2   littoria    Littorina     Littorinidae    Littorina low_mid\n3    panacea Halichondria  Halichondriidae Halichondria     low\n\n\nNotice that the merged data frame contains only the rows that have species information in both data frames. There are also two columns called GENUS and genus because the merge() function treats these as two different variables that originate from the two data frames.\nIf we want to include all data from both data frames then we will need to use the all = TRUE argument. The missing values will be included as NA.\n\ntaxa_zone &lt;- merge(x = taxa, y = zone, all = TRUE)\ntaxa_zone\n\n     species        GENUS           family        genus    zone\n1 balanoides  Semibalanus Archaeobalanidae  Semibalanus    high\n2   digitata         &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;    Laminaria   v_low\n3   littoria    Littorina     Littorinidae    Littorina low_mid\n4    panacea Halichondria  Halichondriidae Halichondria     low\n5  parietina         &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;    Xanthoria  v_high\n6   serratus         &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;        Fucus low_mid\n7    vulgata      Patella       patellidae         &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nIf the variable names that you want to base the merge on are different in each data frame (for example GENUS and genus) you can specify the names in the first data frame (known as x) and the second data frame (known as y) using the by.x = and by.y = arguments.\n\ntaxa_zone &lt;- merge(x = taxa, y = zone, by.x = \"GENUS\", by.y = \"genus\", all = TRUE)\ntaxa_zone\n\n         GENUS  species.x           family  species.y    zone\n1        Fucus       &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;   serratus low_mid\n2 Halichondria    panacea  Halichondriidae    panacea     low\n3    Laminaria       &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;   digitata   v_low\n4    Littorina   littoria     Littorinidae   littoria low_mid\n5      Patella    vulgata       patellidae       &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n6  Semibalanus balanoides Archaeobalanidae balanoides    high\n7    Xanthoria       &lt;NA&gt;             &lt;NA&gt;  parietina  v_high\n\n\nOr using multiple variable names.\n\ntaxa_zone &lt;- merge(x = taxa, y = zone, by.x = c(\"species\", \"GENUS\"), \n                    by.y = c(\"species\", \"genus\"), all = TRUE)\ntaxa_zone\n\n     species        GENUS           family    zone\n1 balanoides  Semibalanus Archaeobalanidae    high\n2   digitata    Laminaria             &lt;NA&gt;   v_low\n3   littoria    Littorina     Littorinidae low_mid\n4    panacea Halichondria  Halichondriidae     low\n5  parietina    Xanthoria             &lt;NA&gt;  v_high\n6   serratus        Fucus             &lt;NA&gt; low_mid\n7    vulgata      Patella       patellidae    &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Reshaping data frames\nReshaping data into different formats is a common task. With rectangular type data (data frames have the same number of rows in each column) there are two main data frame shapes that you will come across: the ‘long’ format (sometimes called stacked) and the ‘wide’ format. An example of a long format data frame is given below. We can see that each row is a single observation from an individual subject and each subject can have multiple rows. This results in a single column of our measurement.\n\nlong_data &lt;- data.frame(\n             subject = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"), each = 3),\n             sex = rep(c(\"M\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\"), each =3),\n             condition = rep(c(\"control\", \"cond1\", \"cond2\"), times = 4),\n             measurement = c(12.9, 14.2, 8.7, 5.2, 12.6, 10.1, 8.9,\n                             12.1, 14.2, 10.5, 12.9, 11.9))\nlong_data\n\n   subject sex condition measurement\n1        A   M   control        12.9\n2        A   M     cond1        14.2\n3        A   M     cond2         8.7\n4        B   F   control         5.2\n5        B   F     cond1        12.6\n6        B   F     cond2        10.1\n7        C   F   control         8.9\n8        C   F     cond1        12.1\n9        C   F     cond2        14.2\n10       D   M   control        10.5\n11       D   M     cond1        12.9\n12       D   M     cond2        11.9\n\n\n \nWe can also format the same data in the wide format as shown below. In this format we have multiple observations from each subject in a single row with measurements in different columns (control, cond1 and cond2). This is a common format when you have repeated measurements from sampling units.\n\nwide_data &lt;- data.frame(subject = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n               sex = c(\"M\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\"),\n               control = c(12.9, 5.2, 8.9, 10.5),\n               cond1 = c(14.2, 12.6, 12.1, 12.9),\n               cond2 = c(8.7, 10.1, 14.2, 11.9))\nwide_data\n\n  subject sex control cond1 cond2\n1       A   M    12.9  14.2   8.7\n2       B   F     5.2  12.6  10.1\n3       C   F     8.9  12.1  14.2\n4       D   M    10.5  12.9  11.9\n\n\n \nWhilst there’s no inherent problem with either of these formats we will sometimes need to convert between the two because some functions will require a specific format for them to work. The most common format is the long format.\nThere are many ways to convert between these two formats but we’ll use the melt() and dcast() functions from the reshape2 package (you will need to install this package first). The melt() function is used to convert from wide to long formats. The first argument for the melt() function is the data frame we want to melt (in our case wide_data). The id.vars = c(\"subject\", \"sex\") argument is a vector of the variables you want to stack, the measured.vars = c(\"control\", \"cond1\", \"cond2\") argument identifies the columns of the measurements in different conditions, the variable.name = \"condition\" argument specifies what you want to call the stacked column of your different conditions in your output data frame and value.name = \"measurement\" is the name of the column of your stacked measurements in your output data frame.\n\nlibrary(reshape2)\nwide_data    # remind ourselves what the wide format looks like\n\n  subject sex control cond1 cond2\n1       A   M    12.9  14.2   8.7\n2       B   F     5.2  12.6  10.1\n3       C   F     8.9  12.1  14.2\n4       D   M    10.5  12.9  11.9\n\n# convert wide to long\nmy_long_df &lt;- melt(data = wide_data, id.vars = c(\"subject\", \"sex\"),\n                   measured.vars = c(\"control\", \"cond1\", \"cond2\"),\n                   variable.name = \"condition\", value.name = \"measurement\")\nmy_long_df\n\n   subject sex condition measurement\n1        A   M   control        12.9\n2        B   F   control         5.2\n3        C   F   control         8.9\n4        D   M   control        10.5\n5        A   M     cond1        14.2\n6        B   F     cond1        12.6\n7        C   F     cond1        12.1\n8        D   M     cond1        12.9\n9        A   M     cond2         8.7\n10       B   F     cond2        10.1\n11       C   F     cond2        14.2\n12       D   M     cond2        11.9\n\n\nThe dcast() function is used to convert from a long format data frame to a wide format data frame. The first argument is again is the data frame we want to cast (long_data for this example). The second argument is in formula syntax. The subject + sex bit of the formula means that we want to keep these columns separate, and the ~ condition part is the column that contains the labels that we want to split into new columns in our new data frame. The value.var = \"measurement\" argument is the column that contains the measured data.\n\nlong_data   # remind ourselves what the long format look like\n\n   subject sex condition measurement\n1        A   M   control        12.9\n2        A   M     cond1        14.2\n3        A   M     cond2         8.7\n4        B   F   control         5.2\n5        B   F     cond1        12.6\n6        B   F     cond2        10.1\n7        C   F   control         8.9\n8        C   F     cond1        12.1\n9        C   F     cond2        14.2\n10       D   M   control        10.5\n11       D   M     cond1        12.9\n12       D   M     cond2        11.9\n\n# convert long to wide\nmy_wide_df &lt;- dcast(data = long_data, subject + sex ~ condition, \n                    value.var = \"measurement\")\nmy_wide_df\n\n  subject sex cond1 cond2 control\n1       A   M  14.2   8.7    12.9\n2       B   F  12.6  10.1     5.2\n3       C   F  12.1  14.2     8.9\n4       D   M  12.9  11.9    10.5",

    "text": "3.5 Summarising data frames\nNow that we’re able to manipulate and extract data from our data frames our next task is to start exploring and getting to know our data. In this section we’ll start producing tables of useful summary statistics of the variables in our data frame and in the next two Chapters we’ll cover visualising our data with base R graphics and using the ggplot2 package.\nA really useful starting point is to produce some simple summary statistics of all of the variables in our flowers data frame using the summary() function.\n\nsummary(flowers)\n\n    treat             nitrogen      block         height           weight      \n Length:96          low   :32   Min.   :1.0   Min.   : 1.200   Min.   : 5.790  \n Class :character   medium:32   1st Qu.:1.0   1st Qu.: 4.475   1st Qu.: 9.027  \n Mode  :character   high  :32   Median :1.5   Median : 6.450   Median :11.395  \n                                Mean   :1.5   Mean   : 6.840   Mean   :12.155  \n                                3rd Qu.:2.0   3rd Qu.: 9.025   3rd Qu.:14.537  \n                                Max.   :2.0   Max.   :17.200   Max.   :23.890  \n    leafarea       shootarea         flowers      \n Min.   : 5.80   Min.   :  5.80   Min.   : 1.000  \n 1st Qu.:11.07   1st Qu.: 39.05   1st Qu.: 4.000  \n Median :13.45   Median : 70.05   Median : 6.000  \n Mean   :14.05   Mean   : 79.78   Mean   : 7.062  \n 3rd Qu.:16.45   3rd Qu.:113.28   3rd Qu.: 9.000  \n Max.   :49.20   Max.   :189.60   Max.   :17.000  \n\n\nFor numeric variables (i.e. height, weight etc) the mean, minimum, maximum, median, first (lower) quartile and third (upper) quartile are presented. For factor variables (i.e. treat and nitrogen) the number of observations in each of the factor levels is given. If a variable contains missing data then the number of NA values is also reported.\nIf we wanted to summarise a smaller subset of variables in our data frame we can use our indexing skills in combination with the summary() function. For example, to summarise only the height, weight, leafarea and shootarea variables we can include the appropriate column indexes when using the [ ]. Notice we include all rows by not specifying a row index.\n\nsummary(flowers[, 4:7])\n\n     height           weight          leafarea       shootarea     \n Min.   : 1.200   Min.   : 5.790   Min.   : 5.80   Min.   :  5.80  \n 1st Qu.: 4.475   1st Qu.: 9.027   1st Qu.:11.07   1st Qu.: 39.05  \n Median : 6.450   Median :11.395   Median :13.45   Median : 70.05  \n Mean   : 6.840   Mean   :12.155   Mean   :14.05   Mean   : 79.78  \n 3rd Qu.: 9.025   3rd Qu.:14.537   3rd Qu.:16.45   3rd Qu.:113.28  \n Max.   :17.200   Max.   :23.890   Max.   :49.20   Max.   :189.60  \n\n# or equivalently \n# summary(flowers[, c(\"height\", \"weight\", \"leafarea\", \"shootarea\")])\n\nAnd to summarise a single variable.\n\nsummary(flowers$leafarea)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n   5.80   11.07   13.45   14.05   16.45   49.20 \n\n# or equivalently\n# summary(flowers[, 6])\n\nAs you’ve seen above, the summary() function reports the number of observations in each level of our factor variables. Another useful function for generating tables of counts is the table() function. The table() function can be used to build contingency tables of different combinations of factor levels. For example, to count the number of observations for each level of nitrogen\n\ntable(flowers$nitrogen)\n\n\n   low medium   high \n    32     32     32 \n\n\nWe can extend this further by producing a table of counts for each combination of nitrogen and treat factor levels.\n\ntable(flowers$nitrogen, flowers$treat)\n\n        \n         notip tip\n  low       16  16\n  medium    16  16\n  high      16  16\n\n\nA more flexible version of the table() function is the xtabs() function. The xtabs() function uses a formula notation (~) to build contingency tables with the cross-classifying variables separated by a + symbol on the right hand side of the formula. xtabs() also has a useful data = argument so you don’t have to include the data frame name when specifying each variable.\n\nxtabs(~ nitrogen + treat, data = flowers)\n\n        treat\nnitrogen notip tip\n  low       16  16\n  medium    16  16\n  high      16  16\n\n\nWe can even build more complicated contingency tables using more variables. Note, in the example below the xtabs() function has quietly coerced our block variable to a factor.\n\nxtabs(~ nitrogen + treat + block, data = flowers)\n\n, , block = 1\n\n        treat\nnitrogen notip tip\n  low        8   8\n  medium     8   8\n  high       8   8\n\n, , block = 2\n\n        treat\nnitrogen notip tip\n  low        8   8\n  medium     8   8\n  high       8   8\n\n\nAnd for a nicer formatted table we can nest the xtabs() function inside the ftable() function to ‘flatten’ the table.\n\nftable(xtabs(~ nitrogen + treat + block, data = flowers))\n\n               block 1 2\nnitrogen treat          \nlow      notip       8 8\n         tip         8 8\nmedium   notip       8 8\n         tip         8 8\nhigh     notip       8 8\n         tip         8 8\n\n\nWe can also summarise our data for each level of a factor variable. Let’s say we want to calculate the mean value of height for each of our low, meadium and high levels of nitrogen. To do this we will use the mean() function and apply this to the height variable for each level of nitrogen using the tapply() function.\n\ntapply(flowers$height, flowers$nitrogen, mean)\n\n     low   medium     high \n5.853125 7.012500 7.653125 \n\n\nThe tapply() function is not just restricted to calculating mean values, you can use it to apply many of the functions that come with R or even functions you’ve written yourself (see Chapter 7 for more details). For example, we can apply the sd() function to calculate the standard deviation for each level of nitrogen or even the summary() function.\n\ntapply(flowers$height, flowers$nitrogen, sd)\n\n     low   medium     high \n2.828425 3.005345 3.483323 \n\ntapply(flowers$height, flowers$nitrogen, summary)\n\n$low\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  1.800   3.600   5.550   5.853   8.000  12.300 \n\n$medium\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  1.800   4.500   7.000   7.013   9.950  12.300 \n\n$high\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. \n  1.200   5.800   7.450   7.653   9.475  17.200 \n\n\nNote, if the variable you want to summarise contains missing values (NA) you will also need to include an argument specifying how you want the function to deal with the NA values. We saw an example if this in Chapter 2 where the mean() function returned an NA when we had missing data. To include the na.rm = TRUE argument we simply add this as another argument when using tapply().\n\ntapply(flowers$height, flowers$nitrogen, mean, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n     low   medium     high \n5.853125 7.012500 7.653125 \n\n\nWe can also use tapply() to apply functions to more than one factor. The only thing to remember is that the factors need to be supplied to the tapply() function in the form of a list using the list() function. To calculate the mean height for each combination of nitrogen and treat factor levels we can use the list(flowers$nitrogen, flowers$treat) notation.\n\ntapply(flowers$height, list(flowers$nitrogen, flowers$treat), mean)\n\n         notip    tip\nlow    3.66875 8.0375\nmedium 4.83750 9.1875\nhigh   5.70625 9.6000\n\n\nAnd if you get a little fed up with having to write flowers$ for every variable you can nest the tapply() function inside the with() function. The with() function allows R to evaluate an R expression with respect to a named data object (in this case flowers).\n\nwith(flowers, tapply(height, list(nitrogen, treat), mean))\n\n         notip    tip\nlow    3.66875 8.0375\nmedium 4.83750 9.1875\nhigh   5.70625 9.6000\n\n\nThe with() function also works with many other functions and can save you alot of typing!\nAnother really useful function for summarising data is the aggregate() function. The aggregate() function works in a very similar way to tapply() but is a bit more flexible.\nFor example, to calculate the mean of the variables height, weight, leafarea and shootarea for each level of nitrogen.\n\naggregate(flowers[, 4:7], by = list(nitrogen = flowers$nitrogen), FUN = mean)\n\n  nitrogen   height    weight leafarea shootarea\n1      low 5.853125  8.652812 11.14375   45.1000\n2   medium 7.012500 11.164062 13.83125   67.5625\n3     high 7.653125 16.646875 17.18125  126.6875\n\n\nIn the code above we have indexed the columns we want to summarise in the flowers data frame using flowers[, 4:7]. The by = argument specifies a list of factors (list(nitrogen = flowers$nitrogen)) and the FUN = argument names the function to apply (mean in this example).\nSimilar to the tapply() function we can include more than one factor to apply a function to. Here we calculate the mean values for each combination of nitrogen and treat\n\naggregate(flowers[, 4:7], by = list(nitrogen = flowers$nitrogen,\n                                 treat = flowers$treat), FUN = mean)\n\n  nitrogen treat  height    weight leafarea shootarea\n1      low notip 3.66875  8.289375 12.32500  59.89375\n2   medium notip 4.83750 11.316875 14.17500  94.53125\n3     high notip 5.70625 16.604375 18.81875 155.31875\n4      low   tip 8.03750  9.016250  9.96250  30.30625\n5   medium   tip 9.18750 11.011250 13.48750  40.59375\n6     high   tip 9.60000 16.689375 15.54375  98.05625\n\n\nWe can also use the aggregate() function in a different way by using the formula method (as we did with xtabs()). On the left hand side of the formula (~) we specify the variable we want to apply the mean function on and to the right hand side our factors separated by a + symbol. The formula method also allows you to use the data = argument for convenience.\n\naggregate(height ~ nitrogen + treat, FUN = mean, data = flowers)\n\n  nitrogen treat  height\n1      low notip 3.66875\n2   medium notip 4.83750\n3     high notip 5.70625\n4      low   tip 8.03750\n5   medium   tip 9.18750\n6     high   tip 9.60000\n\n\nOne advantage of using the formula method is that we can also use the subset = argument to apply the function to subsets of the original data. For example, to calculate the mean height for each combination of the nitrogen and treat levels but only for those plants that have less than 7 flowers.\n\naggregate(height ~ nitrogen + treat, FUN = mean, subset = flowers &lt; 7, data = flowers)\n\n  nitrogen treat   height\n1      low notip 3.533333\n2   medium notip 5.316667\n3     high notip 3.850000\n4      low   tip 8.176923\n5   medium   tip 8.570000\n6     high   tip 7.900000\n\n\nOr for only those plants in block 1.\n\naggregate(height ~ nitrogen + treat, FUN = mean, subset = block == \"1\", data = flowers)\n\n  nitrogen treat  height\n1      low notip  3.3250\n2   medium notip  5.2375\n3     high notip  5.9250\n4      low   tip  8.7500\n5   medium   tip  9.5375\n6     high   tip 10.0375",

    "section": "\n3.6 Exporting data",
    "text": "3.6 Exporting data\nBy now we hope you’re getting a feel for how powerful and useful R is for manipulating and summarising data (and we’ve only really scratched the surface). One of the great benefits of doing all your data wrangling in R is that you have a permanent record of all the things you’ve done to your data. Gone are the days of making undocumented changes in Excel or Calc! By treating your data as ‘read only’ and documenting all of your decisions in R you will have made great strides towards making your analysis more reproducible and transparent to others. It’s important to realise, however, that any changes you’ve made to your data frame in R will not change the original data file you imported into R (and that’s a good thing). Happily it’s straightforward to export data frames to external files in a wide variety of formats.\n\n3.6.1 Export functions\nThe main workhorse function for exporting data frames is the write.table() function. As with the read.table() function, the write.table() function is very flexible with lots of arguments to help customise it’s behaviour. As an example, let’s take our original flowers data frame, do some useful stuff to it and then export these changes to an external file.\nLet’s order the rows in the data frame in ascending order of height within each level nitrogen. We will also apply a square root transformation on the number of flowers variable (flowers) and a log10 transformation on the height variable and save these as additional columns in our data frame (hopefully this will be somewhat familiar to you!).\n\nflowers_df2 &lt;- flowers[order(flowers$nitrogen, flowers$height), ]\nflowers_df2$flowers_sqrt &lt;- sqrt(flowers_df2$flowers)\nflowers_df2$log10_height &lt;- log10(flowers_df2$height)\nstr(flowers_df2)\n\n'data.frame':   96 obs. of  10 variables:\n $ treat       : chr  \"notip\" \"notip\" \"notip\" \"notip\" ...\n $ nitrogen    : Factor w/ 3 levels \"low\",\"medium\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ block       : int  1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 ...\n $ height      : num  1.8 2.2 2.3 2.4 3 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.7 3.7 ...\n $ weight      : num  6.01 9.97 7.28 9.1 9.93 8.74 7.45 8.92 7.03 8.1 ...\n $ leafarea    : num  17.6 9.6 13.8 14.5 12 16.1 14.1 11.6 7.9 10.5 ...\n $ shootarea   : num  46.2 63.1 32.8 78.7 56.6 39.1 38.1 55.2 36.7 60.5 ...\n $ flowers     : int  4 2 6 8 6 3 4 6 5 6 ...\n $ flowers_sqrt: num  2 1.41 2.45 2.83 2.45 ...\n $ log10_height: num  0.255 0.342 0.362 0.38 0.477 ...\n\n\nNow we can export our new data frame flowers_df2 using the write.table() function. The first argument is the data frame you want to export (flowers_df2 in our example). We then give the filename (with file extension) and the file path in either single or double quotes using the file = argument. In this example we’re exporting the data frame to a file called flowers_04_12.txt in the data directory. The col.names = TRUE argument indicates that the variable names should be written in the first row of the file and the row.names = FALSE argument stops R from including the row names in the first column of the file. Finally, the sep = \"\\t\" argument indicates that a Tab should be used as the delimiter in the exported file.\n\nwrite.table(flowers_df2, file = 'data/flowers_04_12.txt', col.names = TRUE,\n             row.names = FALSE, sep = \"\\t\")\n\nAs we saved the file as a tab delimited text file we could open this file in any text editor. Perhaps a more familiar option would be to open the file in Excel. First start Excel and then select File -&gt; Open .. in the main menu and then select our flowers_04_12.txt file to open. Next. choose the ‘Tab’ option to set the delimiter and then click on the ‘Finish’ button.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWe can of course export our files in a variety of other formats. Another popular option is to export files in csv (comma separated values) format. We can do this using the write.table() function by setting the separator argument to sep = \",\".\n\nwrite.table(flowers_df2, file = 'data/flowers_04_12.csv', col.names = TRUE,\n             row.names = FALSE, sep = \",\")\n\nOr alternatively by using the convenience function write.csv(). Notice that we don’t need to set the sep = \",\" or col.names = TRUE arguments as these are the defaults when using the read.csv() function.\n\nwrite.csv(flowers_df2, file = 'data/flowers_04_12.csv', row.names = FALSE)\n\n\n3.6.2 Other export functions\nAs with importing data files into R, there are also many alternative functions for exporting data to external files beyond the write.table() function. If you followed the ‘Other import functions’ section of this Chapter you will already have the required packages installed.\nThe fwrite() function from the read.table package is very efficient at exporting large data objects and is much faster than the write.table() function. It’s also quite simple to use as it has most of the same arguments as write.table(). To export a tab delimited text file we just need to specify the data frame name, the output file name and file path and the separator between columns.\n\nlibrary(read.table)\nfwrite(flowers_df2, file = 'data/flowers_04_12.txt', sep = \"\\t\")\n\nTo export a csv delimited file it’s even easier as we don’t even need to include the sep = argument.\n\nlibrary(read.table)\nfwrite(flowers_df2, file = 'data/flowers_04_12.csv')\n\nThe readr package also comes with two useful functions for quickly writing data to external files: the write_tsv() function for writing tab delimited files and the write_csv() function for saving comma separated values (csv) files.\n\nlibrary(readr)\nwrite_tsv(flowers_df2, path = 'data/flowers_04_12.txt')\n\nwrite_csv(flowers_df2, path = 'data/flowers_04_12.csv')",

    "title": "4  Graphics with R",
    "section": "",
    "text": "4.1 Simple base R plots\nThere are many functions in R to produce plots ranging from the very basic to the highly complex. It’s impossible to cover every aspect of producing graphics in R in this book so we’ll introduce you to most of the common methods of graphing data and describe how to customise your graphs later on in this Chapter.\nThe most common high level function used to produce plots in R is (rather unsurprisingly) the plot() function. For example, let’s plot the weight of petunia plants from our flowers data frame which we imported in Chapter 3.\nflowers &lt;- read.csv(file = \"data/flower.csv\")\n\nplot(flowers$weight)\nR has plotted the values of weight (on the y axis) against an index since we are only plotting one variable to plot. The index is just the order of the weight values in the data frame (1 first in the data frame and 97 last). The weight variable name has been automatically included as a y axis label and the axes scales have been automatically set.\nIf we’d only included the variable weight rather than flowers$weight, the plot() function will display an error as the variable weight only exists in the flowers data frame object.\nplot(weight)\n## Error in plot(weight) : object 'weight' not found\nAs many of the base R plotting functions don’t have a data = argument to specify the data frame name directly we can use the with()\\index{with()} function in combination with plot() as a shortcut.\nwith(flowers, plot(weight))\nTo plot a scatterplot of one numeric variable against another numeric variable we just need to include both variables as arguments when using the plot() function. For example to plot shootarea on the y axis and weight of the x axis.\nplot(x = flowers$weight, y = flowers$shootarea)\nThere is an equivalent approach for these types of plots which often causes some confusion at first. You can also use the formula notation when using the plot() function. However, in contrast to the previous method the formula method requires you to specify the y axis variable first, then a ~ and then our x axis variable.\nplot(shootarea ~ weight, data = flowers)\nBoth of these two approaches are equivalent so we suggest that you just choose the one you prefer and go with it.\nYou can also specify the type of graph you wish to plot using the argument type =. You can plot just the points (type = \"p\", this is the default), just lines (type = \"l\"), both points and lines connected (type = \"b\"), both points and lines with the lines running through the points (type = \"o\") and empty points joined by lines (type = \"c\"). For example, let’s use our skills from Chapter 2 to generate two vectors of numbers (my_x and my_y) and then plot one against the other using different type = values to see what type of plots are produced. Don’t worry about the par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) line of code yet. We’re just using this to split the plotting device so we can fit all four plots on the same device to save some space. See later in the Chapter for more details about this. The top left plot is type = \"l\", the top right type = \"b\", bottom left type = \"o\" and bottom right is type = \"c\".\nmy_x &lt;- 1:10\nmy_y &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 2)\n\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nplot(my_x, my_y, type = \"l\")\nplot(my_x, my_y, type = \"b\")\nplot(my_x, my_y, type = \"o\")\nplot(my_x, my_y, type = \"c\")\nAdmittedly the plots we’ve produced so far don’t look anything particularly special. However, the plot() function is incredibly versatile and can generate a large range of plots which you can customise to your own taste. We’ll cover how to customise plots later in the Chapter. As a quick aside, the plot() function is also what’s known as a generic function which means it can change its default behaviour depending on the type of object used as an argument. You will see an example of this in Chapter 5 where we use the plot() function to generate diagnostic plots of residuals from a linear model object (bet you can’t wait!).",

Using base R, the hist() function takes a numeric vector as its main argument. In ggplot, we need to use geom_histogram(). Let’s generate a histogram of the height values.\nWith base R\n\nhist(flowers$height)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith ggplot2\n\nggplot(flowers, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hist() and geom_histogram() function automatically creates the breakpoints (or bins) in the histogram unless you specify otherwise by using the breaks = argument. For example, let’s say we want to plot our histogram with breakpoints every 1 cm flower height. We first generate a sequence from zero to the maximum value of height (18 rounded up) in steps of 1 using the seq() function. We can then use this sequence with the breaks = argument. While we’re at it, let’s also replace the ugly title for something a little better using the main = argument\n\nbrk &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 18, by = 1)\nhist(flowers$height, breaks = brk, main = \"petunia height\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbrk &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 18, by = 1)\nggplot(flowers, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_histogram(breaks = brk) +\n  ggtitle(\"petunia height\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also display the histogram as a proportion rather than a frequency by using the freq = FALSE argument to hist() or indicating aes(y = after_stat(density)) in geom_histogram().\n\nbrk &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 18, by = 1)\nhist(flowers$height,\n  breaks = brk, main = \"petunia height\",\n  freq = FALSE\n)\nggplot(flowers, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), breaks = brk) +\n  ggtitle(\"petunia height\")\n\nAn alternative to plotting just a straight up histogram is to add a [kernel density][kernel-dens] curve to the plot. In base R, you first need to compute the kernel density estimates using the density() and then ad the estimates to plot as a line using the lines() function.\n\ndens &lt;- density(flowers$height)\nhist(flowers$height,\n  breaks = brk, main = \"petunia height\",\n  freq = FALSE\n)\nlines(dens)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith ggplot, you can simply add the geom_density() layer to the plot\n\nggplot(flowers, aes(x = height)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), breaks = brk) +\n  geom_density() +\n  ggtitle(\"petunia height\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Box plots\nOK, we’ll just come and out and say it, we love boxplots and their close relation the violin plot. Boxplots (or box-and-whisker plots to give them their full name) are very useful when you want to graphically summarise the distribution of a variable, identify potential unusual values and compare distributions between different groups. The reason we love them is their ease of interpretation, transparency and relatively high data-to-ink ratio (i.e. they convey lots of information efficiently). We suggest that you try to use boxplots as much as possible when exploring your data and avoid the temptation to use the more ubiquitous bar plot (even with standard error or 95% confidence intervals bars). The problem with bar plots (aka dynamite plots) is that they hide important information from the reader such as the distribution of the data and assume that the error bars (or confidence intervals) are symmetric around the mean. Of course, it’s up to you what you do but if you’re tempted to use bar plots just Google ‘dynamite plots are evil’ or see [here][dynamite-plot1] or [here][dynamite-plot2] for a fuller discussion.\nTo create a boxplot in R we use the boxplot() function. For example, let’s create a boxplot of the variable weight from our flowers data frame. We can also include a y axis label using the ylab = argument.\n\nboxplot(flowers$weight, ylab = \"weight (g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(flowers, aes(y = weight)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"weight (g)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe thick horizontal line in the middle of the box is the median value of weight (around 11 g). The upper line of the box is the upper quartile (75th percentile) and the lower line is the lower quartile (25th percentile). The distance between the upper and lower quartiles is known as the inter quartile range and represents the values of weight for 50% of the data. The dotted vertical lines are called the whiskers and their length is determined as 1.5 x the inter quartile range. Data points that are plotted outside the the whiskers represent potential unusual observations. This doesn’t mean they are unusual, just that they warrant a closer look. We recommend using boxplots in combination with Cleveland dotplots to identify potential unusual observations (see the next section of this Chapter for more details). The neat thing about boxplots is that they not only provide a measure of central tendency (the median value) they also give you an idea about the distribution of the data. If the median line is more or less in the middle of the box (between the upper and lower quartiles) and the whiskers are more or less the same length then you can be reasonably sure the distribution of your data is symmetrical.\nIf we want examine how the distribution of a variable changes between different levels of a factor we need to use the formula notation with the boxplot() function. For example, let’s plot our weight variable again, but this time see how this changes with each level of nitrogen. When we use the formula notation with boxplot() we can use the data = argument to save some typing. We’ll also introduce an x axis label using the xlab = argument.\n\nboxplot(weight ~ nitrogen,\n  data = flowers,\n  ylab = \"Weight (g)\", xlab = \"nitrogen level\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(flowers, aes(y = weight, x = nitrogen)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Weight (g)\", x = \"Nitrogen Concentration\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe factor levels are plotted in the same order defined by our factor variable nitrogen (often alphabetically). To change the order we need to change the order of our levels of the nitrogen factor in our data frame using the factor() function and then re-plot the graph. Let’s plot our boxplot with our factor levels going from low to high.\n\nflowers$nitrogen &lt;- factor(flowers$nitrogen,\n  levels = c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\")\n)\nggplot(flowers, aes(y = weight, x = nitrogen)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Weight (g)\", x = \"Nitrogen Concentration\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also group our variables by two factors in the same plot. Let’s plot our weight variable but this time plot a separate box for each nitrogen and treatment (treat) combination.\n\nboxplot(weight ~ nitrogen * treat,\n  data = flowers,\n  ylab = \"weight (g)\", xlab = \"nitrogen level\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(flowers, aes(y = weight, x = nitrogen)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(y = \"Weight (g)\", x = \"Nitrogen Concentration\") +\n  facet_grid(. ~ treat)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot looks much better in ggplot with the use of facet_grid allowing to make similar plots as a function of a third (or even fourth) variable.\n\n4.3.4 Violin plots\nViolin plots are like a combination of a boxplot and a kernel density plot (you saw an example of a kernel density plot in the histogram section above) all rolled into one figure. We can create a violin plot in R using the vioplot() function from the vioplot package. You’ll need to first install this package using install.packages('vioplot') function as usual. The nice thing about the vioplot() function is that you use it in pretty much the same way you would use the boxplot() function. We’ll also use the argument col = \"lightblue\" to change the fill colour to light blue.\n\nlibrary(vioplot)\nvioplot(weight ~ nitrogen,\n  data = flowers,\n  ylab = \"weight (g)\", xlab = \"Nitrogen Concentration\",\n  col = \"lightblue\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the violin plot above we have our familiar boxplot for each nitrogen level but this time the median value is represented by a white circle. Plotted around each boxplot is the kernel density plot which represents the distribution of the data for each nitrogen level.\n\nggplot(flowers, aes(y = weight, x = nitrogen)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1) +\n  labs(y = \"Weight (g)\", x = \"Nitrogen Concentration\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Dot charts\nIdentifying unusual observations (aka outliers) in numeric variables is extremely important as they may influence parameter estimates in your statistical model or indicate an error in your data. A really useful (if undervalued) plot to help identify outliers is the Cleveland dotplot. You can produce a dotplot in R very simply by using the dotchart() function.\n\ndotchart(flowers$height)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the dotplot above the data from the height variable is plotted along the x axis and the data is plotted in the order it occurs in the flowers data frame on the y axis (values near the top of the y axis occur later in the data frame with those lower down occurring at the beginning of the data frame). In this plot we have a single value extending to the right at about 17 cm but it doesn’t appear particularly large compared to the rest. An example of a dotplot with an unusual observation is given below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also group the values in our height variable by a factor variable such as nitrogen using the groups = argument. This is useful for identifying unusual observations within a factor level that might be obscured when looking at all the data together.\n\ndotchart(flowers$height, groups = flowers$nitrogen)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggdotchart(data=flowers, x=\"height\", y= \"nitrogen\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.6 Pairs plots\nPreviously in this Chapter we used the plot() function to create a scatterplot to explore the relationship between two numeric variables. With datasets that contain many numeric variables, it’s often handy to create multiple scatterplots to visualise relationships between all these variables. We could use the plot() function to create each of these plot individually, but a much easier way is to use the pairs() function. The pairs() function creates a multi-panel scatterplot (sometimes called a scatterplot matrix) which plots all combinations of variables. Let’s create a multi-panel scatterplot of all of the numeric variables in our flowers data frame. Note, you may need to click on the ‘Zoom’ button in RStudio to display the plot clearly.\n\npairs(flowers[, c(\n  \"height\", \"weight\", \"leafarea\",\n  \"shootarea\", \"flowers\"\n)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# or we could use the equivalent\n# pairs(flowers[, 4:8])\n\nInterpretation of the pairs plot takes a bit of getting used to. The panels on the diagonal give the variable names. The first row of plots displays the height variable on the y axis and the variables weight, leafarea, shootarea and flowers on the x axis for each of the four plots respectively. The next row of plots have weight on the y axis and height, leafarea, shootarea and flowers on the x axis. We interpret the rest of the rows in the same way with the last row displaying the flowers variable on the y axis and the other variables on the x axis. Hopefully you’ll notice that the plots below the diagonal are the same plots as those above the diagonal just with the axis reversed.\nTo do pairs plot with ggplot, you nee the ggpairs()function from GGallypackage. The output is quite similar but you have only the lower part of the matrix of plots, you get a density plot on the diagonal and the correlations on the upper part of the plot.\n\nggpairs(flowers[, c(\n  \"height\", \"weight\", \"leafarea\",\n  \"shootarea\", \"flowers\"\n)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pairs() function can be tweak to do similar things and more but is more involved. Have a lok at the great help file for the pairs() function (?pairs)which provide all the details to do something like the plot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.7 Coplots\nWhen examining the relationship between two numeric variables, it is often useful to be able to determine whether a third variable is obscuring or changing any relationship. A really handy plot to use in these situations is a conditioning plot (also known as conditional scatterplot plot) which we can create in R by using the coplot() function. The coplot() function plots two variables but each plot is conditioned (|) by a third variable. This third variable can be either numeric or a factor. As an example, let’s look at how the relationship between the number of flowers (flowers variable) and the weight of petunia plants changes dependent on leafarea. Note the coplot() function has a data = argument so no need to use the $ notation.\n\ncoplot(flowers ~ weight | leafarea, data = flowers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngg_coplot(flowers,\n  x = weight, y = flowers,\n  faceting =leafarea)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt takes a little practice to interpret coplots. The number of flowers is plotted on the y axis and the weight of plants on the x axis. The six plots show the relationship between these two variables for different ranges of leaf area. The bar plot at the top indicates the range of leaf area values for each of the plots. The panels are read from bottom left to top right along each row. For example, the bottom left panel shows the relationship between number of flowers and weight for plants with the lowest range of leaf area values (approximately 5 - 11 cm2). The top right plot shows the relationship between flowers and weight for plants with a leaf area ranging from approximately 16 - 50 cm2. Notice that the range of values for leaf area differs between panels and that the ranges overlap from panel to panel. The coplot() function does it’s best to split the data up to ensure there are an adequate number of data points in each panel. If you don’t want to produce plots with overlapping data in the panel you can set the overlap = argument to overlap = 0\nYou can also use the coplot() function with factor conditioning variables. With gg_coplot() you need to first set the factor as numeric before plotting and specify overlap=0. For example, we can examine the relationship between flowers and weight variables conditioned on the factor nitrogen. The bottom left plot is the relationship between flowers and weight for those plants in the low nitrogen treatment. The top left plot shows the same relationship but for plants in the high nitrogen treatment.\n\ncoplot(flowers ~ weight | nitrogen, data = flowers)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowers &lt;- mutate(flowers, nitrogen_num = as.numeric(nitrogen))\ngg_coplot(flowers,\n  x = weight, y = flowers,\n  faceting =nitrogen_num, overlap = 0)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.8 Summary of plot function\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraph type\nggplot2\nBase R function\n\n\n\nscatterplot\ngeom_point()\nplot()\n\n\nfrequency histogram\ngeom_histogram()\nhist()\n\n\nboxplot\ngeom_boxplot()\nboxplot()\n\n\nCleveland dotplot\nggdotchart()\ndotchart()\n\n\nscatterplot matrix\nggpairs()\npairs()\n\n\nconditioning plot\ngg_coplot()\ncoplot()\n\n\n\n \nHopefully, you’re getting the idea that we can create really informative exploratory plots quite easily using either base R or ggplot graphics.

In the next section we cover how to customise your base R plots to get them to look exactly how you want.",

    "text": "5.1 Simple linear modelling\nLinear models are one of the most widely used models in statistics and data science. They are often thought of as simple models but they’re very flexible and able to model a wide variety of experimental and survey designs. Many of the statistical approaches you may have used previously (such as linear regression, t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA etc) can be expressed as a linear model so the good news is that you’re probably already familiar with linear models (albeit indirectly). They also form the foundation of more complicated modelling approaches and are relatively easy to extended to incorporate additional complexity. During this section we’ll learn how to fit some simple linear models using R and cover some of the more common applications. We won’t go into any detail of the underlying linear modelling theory but rather focus on the practicalities of model fitting and R code.\nThe main function for fitting linear models in R is the lm() function (short for linear model!). The lm() function has many arguments but the most important is the first argument which specifies the model you want to fit using a model formula which typically takes the general form:\nThis model formula is simply read as\nThe response variable is also commonly known as the ‘dependent variable’ and the explanatory variables are sometimes referred to as ‘independent variables’ (or less frequently as ‘predictor variables’). There is also an additional term in our model formula which represents the variation in our response variable not explained by our explanatory variables but you don’t need to specify this when using the lm() function.\nAs mentioned above, many of the statistical ‘tests’ you might have previously used can be expressed as a linear model. For example, if we wanted to perform a bivariate linear regression between a response variable (y) and a single continuous explanatory variable (x) our model formula would simply be\nOn the other hand, if we wanted to use an ANOVA to test whether the group means of a response variable (y) were different between a three level factor (x) our model formula would look like\nOK, hang on, they both look identical, what gives? In addition to the model formula, the type of linear model you fit is also determined by the type of data in your explanatory variable(s) (i.e. what class of data). If your explanatory variable is continuous then you will fit a bivariate linear regression. If your explanatory variable is a factor (i.e. categorical data) you will fit an ANOVA type model.\nYou can also increase the complexity of your linear model by including additional explanatory variables in your model formula. For example, if we wanted to fit a two-way ANOVA both of our explanatory variables x and z would need to be factors and separated by a + symbol\nIf we wanted to perform a factorial ANOVA to identify an interaction between both explanatory variables we would separate our explanatory variables with a : symbol whilst also including our main effects in our model formula\nor by using the equivalent shortcut notation\nIt’s important that you get comfortable with using model formula (and we’ve only given the briefest of explanations above) when using the lm() function (and other functions) as it’s remarkably easy to specifiy a model which is either nonsense or isn’t the model you really wanted to fit. A summary table of various linear model formula and equivalent R code given below.\nOK, time for an example. The data file smoking.txt summarises the results of a study investigating the possible relationship between mortality rate and smoking across 25 occupational groups in the UK. The variable occupational.group specifies the different occupational groups studied, the risk.group variable indicates the relative risk to lung disease for the various occupational groups and smoking is an index of the average number of cigarettes smoked each day (relative to the number smoked across all occupations). The variable mortality is an index of the death rate from lung cancer in each group (relative to the death rate across all occupational groups). In this data set, the response variable is mortality and the potential explanatory variables are smoking which is numeric and risk.group which is a three level factor. The first thing to do is import our data file using the read.table() function as usual and assign the data to an object called smoke. You can find a link to download these data here.\nsmoke &lt;- read.table('data/smoking.txt', header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\", \n                                        stringsAsFactors = TRUE)\nstr(smoke, vec.len = 2)\n\n'data.frame':   25 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ occupational.group: Factor w/ 25 levels \"Administrators\",..: 9 14 2 11 10 ...\n $ risk.group        : Factor w/ 3 levels \"high\",\"low\",\"medium\": 2 1 1 3 1 ...\n $ smoking           : int  77 137 117 94 116 ...\n $ mortality         : int  84 116 123 128 155 ...\n\n# vec.len argument to limited number of ' first elements' to display\nNext, let’s investigate the relationship between the mortality and smoking variables by plotting a scatter plot. We can use either the ggplot2 package or base R graphics to do this. We’ll use ggplot2 this time and our old friend the ggplot() function.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = smoking, y = mortality), data = smoke) +\n    geom_point()\nThe plot does suggest that there is a positive relationship between the smoking index and mortality index.\nTo fit a simple linear model to these data we will use the lm() function and include our model formula mortality ~ smoking and assign the results to an object called smoke_lm.\nsmoke_lm &lt;- lm(mortality ~ smoking, data = smoke)\nNotice that we have not used the $ notation to specify the variables in our model formula, instead we’ve used the data = smoke argument. Although the $ notation will work (i.e. smoke$mortality ~ smoke$smoking) it will more than likely cause you problems later on and should be avoided. In fact, we would go as far to suggest that if any function has a data = argument you should always use it. How do you know if a function has a data = argument? Just look in the associated help file.\nPerhaps somewhat confusingly (at least at first) it appears that nothing much has happened, you don’t automatically get the voluminous output that you normally get with other statistical packages. In fact, what R does, is store the output of the analysis in what is known as a lm class object (which we have called smoke_lm) from which you are able to extract exactly what you want using other functions. If you’re brave, you can examine the structure of the smoke_lm model object using the str() function.\nstr(smoke_lm)\n\nList of 12\n $ coefficients : Named num [1:2] -2.89 1.09\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:2] \"(Intercept)\" \"smoking\"\n $ residuals    : Named num [1:25] 3.15 -30.11 -1.36 28.66 31.73 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:25] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ effects      : Named num [1:25] -545 -91.63 2.72 26.99 35.56 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:25] \"(Intercept)\" \"smoking\" \"\" \"\" ...\n $ rank         : int 2\n $ fitted.values: Named num [1:25] 80.9 146.1 124.4 99.3 123.3 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:25] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n $ assign       : int [1:2] 0 1\n $ qr           :List of 5\n  ..$ qr   : num [1:25, 1:2] -5 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 ...\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  .. .. ..$ : chr [1:25] \"1\" \"2\" \"3\" \"4\" ...\n  .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] \"(Intercept)\" \"smoking\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"assign\")= int [1:2] 0 1\n  ..$ qraux: num [1:2] 1.2 1.46\n  ..$ pivot: int [1:2] 1 2\n  ..$ tol  : num 1e-07\n  ..$ rank : int 2\n  ..- attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"qr\"\n $ df.residual  : int 23\n $ xlevels      : Named list()\n $ call         : language lm(formula = mortality ~ smoking, data = smoke)\n $ terms        :Classes 'terms', 'formula'  language mortality ~ smoking\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"variables\")= language list(mortality, smoking)\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"factors\")= int [1:2, 1] 0 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] \"mortality\" \"smoking\"\n  .. .. .. ..$ : chr \"smoking\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"term.labels\")= chr \"smoking\"\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"order\")= int 1\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"intercept\")= int 1\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"response\")= int 1\n  .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; \n  .. ..- attr(*, \"predvars\")= language list(mortality, smoking)\n  .. ..- attr(*, \"dataClasses\")= Named chr [1:2] \"numeric\" \"numeric\"\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:2] \"mortality\" \"smoking\"\n $ model        :'data.frame':  25 obs. of  2 variables:\n  ..$ mortality: int [1:25] 84 116 123 128 155 101 118 113 104 88 ...\n  ..$ smoking  : int [1:25] 77 137 117 94 116 102 111 93 88 102 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"terms\")=Classes 'terms', 'formula'  language mortality ~ smoking\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"variables\")= language list(mortality, smoking)\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"factors\")= int [1:2, 1] 0 1\n  .. .. .. ..- attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr [1:2] \"mortality\" \"smoking\"\n  .. .. .. .. ..$ : chr \"smoking\"\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"term.labels\")= chr \"smoking\"\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"order\")= int 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"intercept\")= int 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"response\")= int 1\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \".Environment\")=&lt;environment: R_GlobalEnv&gt; \n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"predvars\")= language list(mortality, smoking)\n  .. .. ..- attr(*, \"dataClasses\")= Named chr [1:2] \"numeric\" \"numeric\"\n  .. .. .. ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:2] \"mortality\" \"smoking\"\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"lm\"\nTo obtain a summary of our analysis we can use the summary() function on our smoke_lm model object.\nsummary(smoke_lm)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mortality ~ smoking, data = smoke)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-30.107 -17.892   3.145  14.132  31.732 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The estimate for the Intercept suggests that when the relative smoking index is 0 the relative mortality rate is -2.885! The p value associated with the intercept tests the null hypothesis that the intercept is equal to zero. As the p value is large we fail to reject this null hypothesis. The smoking parameter estimate (1.0875) is the estimate of the slope and suggests that for every unit increase in the average number of cigarettes smoked each day the mortality risk index increases by 1.0875. The p value associated with the smoking parameter tests whether the slope of this relationship is equal to zero (i.e. no relationship). As our p value is small we reject this null hypothesis and therefore the slope is different from zero and therefore there is a significant relationship. The summary table also includes other important information such as the coefficient of determination (R2), adjusted R2 , F statistic, associated degrees of freedom and p value. This information is a condensed form of an ANOVA table which you can see by using the anova() function.\nanova(smoke_lm)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: mortality\n          Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \nsmoking    1 8395.7  8395.7  24.228 5.658e-05 ***\nResiduals 23 7970.3   346.5                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\nNow let’s fit another linear model, but this time we will use the risk.group variable as our explanatory variable. Remember the risk.group variable is a factor and so our linear model will be equivalent to an ANOVA type analysis. We will be testing the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the mean mortality rate between the low, medium and high groups. We fit the model in exactly the same way as before.\nsmoke_risk_lm &lt;- lm(mortality ~ risk.group, data = smoke)\nAgain, we can produce an ANOVA table using the anova() function\nanova(smoke_risk_lm)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nResponse: mortality\n           Df  Sum Sq Mean Sq F value    Pr(&gt;F)    \nrisk.group  2 11514.4  5757.2  26.107 1.554e-06 ***\nResiduals  22  4851.6   220.5                      \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\nThe results presented in the ANOVA table suggest that we can reject the null hypothesis (very small p value) and therefore the mean mortality rate index is different between low, medium and high risk groups.\nAs we did with our first linear model we can also produce a summary of the estimated parameters using the summary() function.\nsummary(smoke_risk_lm)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mortality ~ risk.group, data = smoke)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n-26.17 -11.45   4.00   9.00  26.83 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.

Therefore, the estimated mean mortality index for high risk individuals is 135. The estimates for risk.grouplow and risk.groupmedium are mean differences from the intercept (high group). So the mortality index for the low group is 135 - 57.83 = 77.17 and for the medium group is 135 - 27.55 = 107.45. The t values and p values in the summary table are associated with testing specific hypotheses. The p value associated with the intercept tests the null hypothesis that the mean mortality index for the high group is equal to zero. To be honest this is not a particularly meaningful hypothesis to test but we can reject it anyway as we have a very small p value. The p value for the risk.grouplow parameter tests the null hypothesis that the mean difference between high and low risk groups is equal to zero (i.e. there is no difference). Again we reject this null hypothesis and conclude that the means are different between these two groups. Similarly, the p value for risk.groupmedium tests the null hypothesis that the mean difference between high and medium groups is equal to zero which we also reject.\nDon’t worry too much if you find the output from the summary() function a little confusing. Its takes a bit of practice and experience to be able to make sense of all the numbers. Remember though, the more complicated your model is, the more complicated your interpretion will be. And always remember, a model that you can’t interpret is not worth fitting (most of the time!).\nAnother approach to interpreting your model output is to plot a graph of your data and then add the fitted model to this plot. Let’s go back to the first linear model we fitted (smoke_lm). We can add the fitted line to our previous plot using the ggplot2 package and the geom_smooth geom. We can easily include the standard errors by specifying the se = TRUE argument.\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = smoking, y = mortality), data = smoke) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = TRUE)\nYou can also do this with R’s base graphics. Note though that the fitted line extends beyond the data which is not great practice. If you want to prevent this you can generate predicted values from the model using the predict() function within the range of your data and then add these values to the plot using the lines() function (not shown).\nplot(smoke$smoking, smoke$mortality, xlab = \"smoking rate\", ylab = \" mortality rate\")\nabline(smoke_lm, col = \"red\")\nBefore we sit back and relax and admire our model (or go write that high impact paper your supervisor/boss has been harassing you about) our work is not finished. It’s vitally important to check the underlying assumptions of your linear model. Two of the most important assumption are equal variances (homogeneity of variance) and normality of residuals. To check for equal variances we can construct a graph of residuals versus fitted values. We can do this by first extracting the residuals and fitted values from our model object using the resid() and fitted() functions.\nsmoke_res &lt;- resid(smoke_lm)\nsmoke_fit &lt;- fitted(smoke_lm)\nAnd then plot them using ggplot or base R graphics.\nggplot(mapping = aes(x = smoke_fit, y = smoke_res)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\")\nIt takes a little practice to interpret these types of graph, but what you are looking for is no pattern or structure in your residuals. What you definitely don’t want to see is the scatter increasing around the zero line (red dashed line) as the fitted values get bigger (this has been described as looking like a trumpet, a wedge of cheese or even a slice of pizza) which would indicate unequal variances (heteroscedacity).\nTo check for normality of residuals we can use our old friend the Q-Q plot using the residuals stored in the smoke_res object we created earlier.\nggplot(mapping = aes(sample = smoke_res)) +\n    stat_qq() + \n    stat_qq_line()\nOr the same plot with base graphics.\nqqnorm(smoke_res)\nqqline(smoke_res)\nAlternatively, you can get R to do most of the hard work by using the plot() function on the model object smoke_lm. Before we do this we should tell R that we want to plot four graphs in the same plotting window in RStudio using the par(mfrow = c(2,2)). This command splits the plotting window into 2 rows and 2 columns.\npar(mfrow = c(2,2))\nplot(smoke_lm)\nThe first two graphs (top left and top right) are the same residual versus fitted and Q-Q plots we produced before. The third graph (bottom left) is the same as the first but plotted on a different scale (the absolute value of the square root of the standardised residuals) and again you are looking for no pattern or structure in the data points. The fourth graph (bottom right) gives you an indication whether any of your observations are having a large influence (Cook’s distance) on your regression coefficient estimates. Levearge identifies observations which have unusually large values in their explanatory variables.\nYou can also produce these diagnostic plots using ggplot by installing the package ggfortify and using the autoplot() function.\nlibrary(ggfortify)\nautoplot(smoke_lm, which = 1:6, ncol = 2, label.size = 3)\nWhat you do about influential data points or data points with high leverage is up to you. If you would like to examine the effect of removing one of these points on the parameter estimates you can use the update() function. Let’s remove data point 2 (miners, mortality = 116 and smoking = 137) and store the results in a new object called smoke_lm2. Note, we do this to demonstrate the use of the update() function. You should think long and hard about removing any data point(s) and if you do you should always report this and justify your reasoning.\nsmoke_lm2 &lt;- update(smoke_lm, subset = -2)\nsummary(smoke_lm2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = mortality ~ smoking, data = smoke, subset = -2)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-29.7425 -11.6920  -0.4745  13.6141  28.7587 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept) -20.0755    23.5798  -0.851    0.404    \nsmoking       1.2693     0.2297   5.526 1.49e-05 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 17.62 on 22 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.5813,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.5622 \nF-statistic: 30.54 on 1 and 22 DF,  p-value: 1.488e-05\nThere are numerous other functions which are useful for producing diagnostic plots. For example, rstandard() and rstudent() returns the standardised and studentised residuals. The function dffits() expresses how much an observation influences the associated fitted value and the function dfbetas() gives the change in the estimated parameters if an observation is excluded, relative to its standard error (intercept is the solid line and slope is the dashed line in the example below). The solid bold line in the same graph represents the Cook’s distance. Examples of how to use these functions are given below.\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(dffits(smoke_lm), type = \"l\")\nplot(rstudent(smoke_lm))\nmatplot(dfbetas(smoke_lm), type = \"l\", col = \"black\")\nlines(sqrt(cooks.distance(smoke_lm)), lwd = 2)",

    "text": "6.1 Looking behind the curtain\nA good way to start learning to program in R is to see what others have done. We can start by briefly peeking behind the curtain. In Chapter 5 we made use of the theme_classic() function when customising our ggplot figures. With many functions in R, if you want to have a quick glance at the machinery behind the scenes, we can simply write the function name but without the (). This is the same trick we used in Chapter 5 to alter the theme_classic() style of ggplot2 to make theme_rbook().\nNote that to view the source code of base R packages (those that come with R) requires some additional steps which we won’t cover here (see this link if you’re interested), but for most other packages that you install yourself, generally entering the function name without () will show the source code of the function.\ntheme_classic\n\nfunction (base_size = 11, base_family = \"\", base_line_size = base_size/22, \n    base_rect_size = base_size/22) \n{\n    theme_bw(base_size = base_size, base_family = base_family, \n        base_line_size = base_line_size, base_rect_size = base_rect_size) %+replace% \n        theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), \n            panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), axis.line = element_line(colour = \"black\", \n                linewidth = rel(1)), legend.key = element_blank(), \n            strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = \"black\", \n                linewidth = rel(2)), complete = TRUE)\n}\n&lt;bytecode: 0x5cce878d8eb8&gt;\n&lt;environment: namespace:ggplot2&gt;\nWhat we see above is the underlying code for this particular function. As we did in Chapter 5, we could copy and paste this into our own script and make any changes we deemed necessary. This approach isn’t limited to ggplot2 functions and can be used for other functions as well, although tread carefully and test the changes you’ve made.\nDon’t worry overly if most of the code contained in functions doesn’t make sense immediately. This will be especially true if you are new to R, in which case it seems incredibly intimidating. To help with that, we’ll begin by making our own functions in R in the next section.",

    "section": "\n6.2 Functions in R",
    "text": "6.2 Functions in R\nFunctions are your loyal servants, waiting patiently to do your bidding to the best of their ability. They’re made with the utmost care and attention … though sometimes may end up being something of a Frankenstein’s monster - with an extra limb or two and a head put on backwards. But no matter how ugly they may be they’re completely faithful to you.\nThey’re also very stupid.\nIf we asked you to go to the supermarket to get us some ingredients to make Francesinha, even if you don’t know what the heck that is, you’d be able to guess and bring at least something back. Or you could decide to make something else. Or you could ask a celebrity chef for help. Or you could pull out your phone and search online for what Francesinha is. The point is, even if we didn’t give you enough information to do the task, you’re intelligent enough to, at the very least, try to find a work around.\nIf instead, we asked our loyal function to do the same, it would listen intently to our request, stand still for a few milliseconds, compose itself, and then start shouting Error: 'data' must be a data frame, or other object .... It would then repeat this every single time we asked it to do the job. The point here, is that code and functions are not intelligent. They cannot find workarounds. It’s totally reliant on you, to tell it very explicitly what it needs to do step by step.\nRemember two things: the intelligence of code comes from the coder, not the computer and functions need exact instructions to work.\nTo prevent functions from being too stupid you must provide the information the function needs in order for it to function. As with the Francesinha example, if we’d supplied a recipe list to the function, it would have managed just fine. We call this “fulfilling an argument”. The vast majority of functions require the user to fulfill at least one argument.\nThis can be illustrated in the pseudocode below. When we make a function we can specify what arguments the user must fulfill (e.g. argument1 and argument2), as well as what to do once it has this information (expression):\n\nnameOfFunction &lt;- function(argument1, argument2, ...) {expression}\n\nThe first thing to note is that we’ve used the function function() to create a new function called nameOfFunction. To walk through the above code; we’re creating a function called nameOfFunction. Within the round brackets we specify what information (i.e. arguments) the function requires to run (as many or as few as needed). These arguments are then passed to the expression part of the function. The expression can be any valid R command or set of R commands and is usually contained between a pair of braces { } (if a function is only one line long you can omit the braces). Once you run the above code, you can then use your new function by typing:\n\nnameOfFunction(argument1, argument2)\n\nConfused? Let’s work through an example to help clear things up.\nFirst we are going to create a data frame called city, where columns porto, aberdeen, nairobi, and genoa are filled with 100 random values drawn from a bag (using the rnorm() function to draw random values from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1). We also include a “problem”, for us to solve later, by including 10 NA values within the nairobi column (using rep(NA, 10)).\n\ncity &lt;- data.frame(\n  porto = rnorm(100),\n  aberdeen = rnorm(100),\n  nairobi = c(rep(NA, 10), rnorm(90)),\n  genoa = rnorm(100)\n)\n\nLet’s say that you want to multiply the values in the variables Porto and Aberdeen and create a new object called porto_aberdeen. We can do this “by hand” using:\n\nporto_aberdeen &lt;- city$porto * city$aberdeen\n\nWe’ve now created an object called porto_aberdeen by multiplying the vectors city$porto and city$aberdeen. Simple. If this was all we needed to do, we can stop here. R works with vectors, so doing these kinds of operations in R is actually much simpler than other programming languages, where this type of code might require loops (we say that R is a vectorised language). Something to keep in mind for later is that doing these kinds of operations with loops can be much slower compared to vectorisation.\nBut what if we want to repeat this multiplication many times? Let’s say we wanted to multiply columns porto and aberdeen, aberdeen and genoa, and nairobi and genoa. In this case we could copy and paste the code, replacing the relevant information.\n\nporto_aberdeen &lt;- city$porto * city$aberdeen\naberdeen_genoa &lt;- city$aberdeen * city$aberdeen\nnairobi_genoa &lt;- city$nairobi * city$genoa\n\nWhile this approach works, it’s easy to make mistakes. In fact, here we’ve “forgotten” to change aberdeen to genoa in the second line of code when copying and pasting. This is where writing a function comes in handy. If we were to write this as a function, there is only one source of potential error (within the function itself) instead of many copy-pasted lines of code (which we also cut down on by using a function).\nIn this case, we’re using some fairly trivial code where it’s maybe hard to make a genuine mistake. But what if we increased the complexity?\n\ncity$porto * city$aberdeen / city$porto + (city$porto * 10^(city$aberdeen)) \n                  - city$aberdeen - (city$porto * sqrt(city$aberdeen + 10))\n\nNow imagine having to copy and paste this three times, and in each case having to change the porto and aberdeen variables (especially if we had to do it more than three times).\nWhat we could do instead is generalise our code for x and y columns instead of naming specific cities. If we did this, we could recycle the x * y code. Whenever we wanted to multiple columns together, we assign a city to either x or y. We’ll assign the multiplication to the objects porto_aberdeen and aberdeen_nairobi so we can come back to them later.\n\n# Assign x and y values\nx &lt;- city$porto\ny &lt;- city$aberdeen\n\n# Use multiplication code\nporto_aberdeen &lt;- x * y\n\n# Assign new x and y values\nx &lt;- city$aberdeen\ny &lt;- city$nairobi\n\n# Reuse multiplication code\naberdeen_nairobi &lt;- x * y\n\nThis is essentially what a function does. OK down to business, let’s call our new function multiply_columns() and define it with two arguments, x and y. In the function code we simply return the value of x * y using the return() function. Using the return() function is not strictly necessary in this example as R will automatically return the value of the last line of code in our function. We include it here to make this explicit.\n\nmultiply_columns &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  return(x * y)\n}\n\nNow that we’ve defined our function we can use it. Let’s use the function to multiple the columns city$porto and city$aberdeen and assign the result to a new object called porto_aberdeen_func\n\nporto_aberdeen_func &lt;- multiply_columns(x = city$porto, y = city$aberdeen)\nporto_aberdeen_func\n\n  [1] -0.417883106 -0.455137858 -0.105017492 -3.038747154 -0.597306087\n  [6] -1.544468763 -1.780126146  0.513887526 -0.800048708 -0.225181002\n [11]  1.102816706 -3.735245507 -0.782184361 -0.019005494  0.556987336\n [16]  0.145887587  0.487905464 -0.182681779 -1.505532565  0.259239976\n [21] -0.057811011 -0.082806731 -0.167469560 -0.158822494 -0.225754891\n [26]  0.038937368  0.195591031 -0.187673214 -1.144562594 -0.271657062\n [31] -2.068600044 -1.401619806  0.027306710  3.584254960 -0.082641523\n [36] -0.807755762  0.017228094 -2.081741668 -0.001005650  0.727854519\n [41] -0.040267120  0.200283103 -0.657638447 -0.073885216 -0.207478375\n [46]  0.081180005 -0.758291150  0.526583096  0.091839747 -0.830062913\n [51]  0.263656395 -0.441103606 -0.855296568  2.820155431 -0.708232690\n [56]  0.028929281  0.022567680  1.713887567 -1.450369605 -0.498092988\n [61]  0.835805415 -0.713527552  0.839584212  0.130383851 -0.139543156\n [66] -0.007310681 -0.886855426  0.124323120 -0.029624615 -2.071462494\n [71]  0.279975278 -1.117158501  0.746022300  0.407781909  0.206859129\n [76] -1.485717427  0.180385516  0.476992629  0.316420449 -1.006098735\n [81] -0.104017225 -0.451001755 -0.002511951 -0.245002399  1.245296722\n [86] -0.285620564 -1.049819869 -0.063995906  0.747945050 -0.946934686\n [91]  0.739307900  0.506750015  2.105892750  0.584623102  0.225269904\n [96] -0.256731529 -0.423109486 -2.783090855  0.513896326  0.917911672\n\n\nIf we’re only interested in multiplying city$porto and city$aberdeen, it would be overkill to create a function to do something once. However, the benefit of creating a function is that we now have that function added to our environment which we can use as often as we like. We also have the code to create the function, meaning we can use it in completely new projects, reducing the amount of code that has to be written (and retested) from scratch each time. As a rule of thumb, you should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice.\nTo satisfy ourselves that the function has worked properly, we can compare the porto_aberdeen variable with our new variable porto_aberdeen_func using the identical() function. The identical() function tests whether two objects are exactly identical and returns either a TRUE or FALSE value. Use ?identical if you want to know more about this function.\n\nidentical(porto_aberdeen, porto_aberdeen_func)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAnd we confirm that the function has produced the same result as when we do the calculation manually. We recommend getting into a habit of checking that the function you’ve created works the way you think it has.\nNow let’s use our multiply_columns() function to multiply columns aberdeen and nairobi. Notice now that argument x is given the value city$aberdeenand y the value city$nairobi.\n\naberdeen_nairobi_func &lt;- multiply_columns(x = city$aberdeen, y = city$nairobi)\naberdeen_nairobi_func\n\n  [1]            NA            NA            NA            NA            NA\n  [6]            NA            NA            NA            NA            NA\n [11]  0.5428299706  1.5202508503 -0.0006130036 -0.0808232484  0.0917860983\n [16]  0.1644158745  0.3578186650  0.7070949636 -0.1505052067 -1.2005463158\n [21]  0.0065394674  0.0617637245  0.1807851251 -0.1824742023 -0.0262209246\n [26] -0.2021980145  0.0902916562 -0.5363534175 -1.4055624026  0.1025329499\n [31]  0.4618666363 -0.0871212543  0.6379734302  0.0328239053  0.6342555497\n [36] -0.3568059489  0.0154094491 -0.7519864945  0.0028152701 -0.4460016781\n [41] -0.0094670462 -0.3859356647  0.3292484102  0.1140071831 -0.8418716495\n [46]  0.0768353648 -0.9607463984 -0.4403186044  0.0392347444 -2.7235385539\n [51] -0.8135236928  1.2380168098  1.0669482417 -0.0555055451 -1.1481926794\n [56] -0.0117955841  2.0504191734 -1.1114654689 -0.7244827326  0.0262440723\n [61]  0.6840780274 -0.4142051651  0.2468536976 -0.0030745565  0.0304451369\n [66] -0.0238242248  0.1383607205  0.2058592924  0.0378588580 -0.3290692982\n [71] -0.8462696896 -2.6583137554 -1.0428266629 -0.9241378265  0.4833409493\n [76] -3.2616440085  0.1828491600 -0.3654885988 -0.1304540933  2.4505507524\n [81]  0.3923966116 -0.4341240170  0.0348232174  0.0349059001  0.3860111432\n [86] -0.3748441499  1.3734344606  0.1280415666  1.9347292472  0.2910058254\n [91]  0.2536771712 -2.6985336455 -1.4802872879  0.0961161374  2.9255640272\n [96]  0.7659604905  0.0843946941 -0.3122195629  3.4818215084 -3.0922828778\n\n\nSo far so good. All we’ve really done is wrapped the code x * y into a function, where we ask the user to specify what their x and y variables are.\nNow let’s add a little complexity. If you look at the output of nairobi_genoa some of the calculations have produced NA values. This is because of those NA values we included in nairobi when we created the city data frame. Despite these NA values, the function appeared to have worked but it gave us no indication that there might be a problem. In such cases we may prefer if it had warned us that something was wrong. How can we get the function to let us know when NA values are produced? Here’s one way.\n\nmultiply_columns &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  temp_var &lt;- x * y\n  if (any(is.na(temp_var))) {\n    warning(\"The function has produced NAs\")\n    return(temp_var)\n  } else {\n    return(temp_var)\n  }\n}\n\naberdeen_nairobi_func &lt;- multiply_columns(city$aberdeen, city$nairobi)\n\nWarning in multiply_columns(city$aberdeen, city$nairobi): The function has\nproduced NAs\n\nporto_aberdeen_func &lt;- multiply_columns(city$porto, city$aberdeen)\n\nThe core of our function is still the same. We still have x * y, but we’ve now got an extra six lines of code. Namely, we’ve included some conditional statements, if and else, to test whether any NAs have been produced and if they have we display a warning message to the user. The next section of this Chapter will explain how these work and how to use them.",

    "section": "\n6.3 Conditional statements",
    "text": "6.3 Conditional statements\nx * y does not apply any logic. It merely takes the value of x and multiplies it by the value of y. Conditional statements are how you inject some logic into your code. The most commonly used conditional statement is if. Whenever you see an if statement, read it as ‘If X is TRUE, do a thing’. Including an else statement simply extends the logic to ‘If X is TRUE, do a thing, or else do something different’.\nBoth the if and else statements allow you to run sections of code, depending on a condition is either TRUE or FALSE. The pseudocode below shows you the general form.\n  if (condition) {\n  Code executed when condition is TRUE\n  } else {\n  Code executed when condition is FALSE\n  }\nTo delve into this a bit more, we can use an old programmer joke to set up a problem.\n\nA programmer’s partner says: ‘Please go to the store and buy a carton of milk and if they have eggs, get six.’\nThe programmer returned with 6 cartons of milk.\nWhen the partner sees this, and exclaims ‘Why the heck did you buy six cartons of milk?’\nThe programmer replied ‘They had eggs’\n\nAt the risk of explaining a joke, the conditional statement here is whether or not the store had eggs. If coded as per the original request, the programmer should bring 6 cartons of milk if the store had eggs (condition = TRUE), or else bring 1 carton of milk if there weren’t any eggs (condition = FALSE). In R this is coded as:\n\neggs &lt;- TRUE # Whether there were eggs in the store\n\n  if (eggs == TRUE) { # If there are eggs\n  n.milk &lt;- 6 # Get 6 cartons of milk\n    } else { # If there are not eggs\n  n.milk &lt;- 1 # Get 1 carton of milk\n  }\n\nWe can then check n.milk to see how many milk cartons they returned with.\n\nn.milk\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nAnd just like the joke, our R code has missed that the condition was to determine whether or not to buy eggs, not more milk (this is actually a loose example of the Winograd Scheme, designed to test the intelligence of artificial intelligence by whether it can reason what the intended referent of a sentence is).\nWe could code the exact same egg-milk joke conditional statement using an ifelse() function.\n\neggs &lt;- TRUE\nn.milk &lt;- ifelse(eggs == TRUE, yes = 6, no = 1)\n\nThis ifelse() function is doing exactly the same as the more fleshed out version from earlier, but is now condensed down into a single line of code. It has the added benefit of working on vectors as opposed to single values (more on this later when we introduce loops). The logic is read in the same way; “If there are eggs, assign a value of 6 to n.milk, if there isn’t any eggs, assign the value 1 to n.milk”.\nWe can check again to make sure the logic is still returning 6 cartons of milk:\n\nn.milk\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nCurrently we’d have to copy and paste code if we wanted to change if eggs were in the store or not. We learned above how to avoid lots of copy and pasting by creating a function. Just as with the simple x * y expression in our previous multiply_columns() function, the logical statements above are straightforward to code and well suited to be turned into a function. How about we do just that and wrap this logical statement up in a function?\n\nmilk &lt;- function(eggs) {\n  if (eggs == TRUE) {\n    6\n  } else {\n    1\n  }\n}\n\nWe’ve now created a function called milk() where the only argument is eggs. The user of the function specifies if eggs is either TRUE or FALSE, and the function will then use a conditional statement to determine how many cartons of milk are returned.\nLet’s quickly try:\n\nmilk(eggs = TRUE)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nAnd the joke is maintained. Notice in this case we have actually specified that we are fulfilling the eggs argument (eggs = TRUE). In some functions, as with ours here, when a function only has a single argument we can be lazy and not name which argument we are fulfilling. In reality, it’s generally viewed as better practice to explicitly state which arguments you are fulfilling to avoid potential mistakes.\nOK, lets go back to the multiply_columns() function we created above and explain how we’ve used conditional statements to warn the user if NA values are produced when we multiple any two columns together.\n\nmultiply_columns &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  temp_var &lt;- x * y\n  if (any(is.na(temp_var))) {\n    warning(\"The function has produced NAs\")\n    return(temp_var)\n  } else {\n    return(temp_var)\n  }\n}\n\nIn this new version of the function we still use x * y as before but this time we’ve assigned the values from this calculation to a temporary vector called temp_var so we can use it in our conditional statements. Note, this temp_var variable is local to our function and will not exist outside of the function due something called R’s scoping rules. We then use an if statement to determine whether our temp_var variable contains any NA values. The way this works is that we first use the is.na() function to test whether each value in our temp_var variable is an NA. The is.na() function returns TRUE if the value is an NA and FALSE if the value isn’t an NA. We then nest the is.na(temp_var) function inside the function any() to test whether any of the values returned by is.na(temp_var) are TRUE. If at least one value is TRUE the any() function will return a TRUE. So, if there are any NA values in our temp_var variable the condition for the if() function will be TRUE whereas if there are no NA values present then the condition will be FALSE. If the condition is TRUE the warning() function generates a warning message for the user and then returns the temp_var variable. If the condition is FALSE the code below the else statement is executed which just returns the temp_var variable.\nSo if we run our modified multiple_columns() function on the columns city$Aberdeen and city$nairobi (which contains NAs) we will receive an warning message.\n\naberdeen_nairobi_func &lt;- multiply_columns(city$aberdeen, city$nairobi)\n\nWarning in multiply_columns(city$aberdeen, city$nairobi): The function has\nproduced NAs\n\n\nWhereas if we multiple two columns that don’t contain NA values we don’t receive a warning message\n\nporto_aberdeen_func &lt;- multiply_columns(city$porto, city$aberdeen)",

    "text": "6.4 Combining logical operators\nThe functions that we’ve created so far have been perfectly suited for what we need, though they have been fairly simplistic. Let’s try creating a function that has a little more complexity to it. We’ll make a function to determine if today is going to be a good day or not based on two criteria. The first criteria will depend on the day of the week (Friday or not) and the second will be whether or not your code is working (TRUE or FALSE). To accomplish this, we’ll be using if and else statements. The complexity will come from if statements immediately following the relevant else statement. We’ll use such conditional statements four times to achieve all combinations of it being a Friday or not, and if your code is working or not.\n\ngood.day &lt;- function(code.working, day) {\n  if (code.working == TRUE && day == \"Friday\") {\n    \"BEST. DAY. EVER. Stop while you are ahead and go to the pub!\"\n  } else if (code.working == FALSE && day == \"Friday\") {\n    \"Oh well, but at least it's Friday! Pub time!\"\n  } else if (code.working == TRUE && day != \"Friday\") {\n    \"So close to a good day... shame it's not a Friday\"\n  } else if (code.working == FALSE && day != \"Friday\") {\n    \"Hello darkness.\"\n  }\n}\n\ngood.day(code.working = TRUE, day = \"Friday\")\n\n[1] \"BEST.

That’s because, for this function, the only thing that matters is whether or not it’s Friday.\nWe’ve also been using logical operators whenever we’ve used if statements. Logical operators are the final piece of the logical conditions jigsaw. Below is a table which summarises operators. The first two are logical operators and the final six are relational operators.

    "section": "\n6.5 Loops",
    "text": "6.5 Loops\nR is very good at performing repetitive tasks. If we want a set of operations to be repeated several times we use what’s known as a loop. When you create a loop, R will execute the instructions in the loop a specified number of times or until a specified condition is met. There are three main types of loop in R: the for loop, the while loop and the repeat loop.\nLoops are one of the staples of all programming languages, not just R, and can be a powerful tool (although in our opinion, used far too frequently when writing R code).\n\n6.5.1 For loop\nThe most commonly used loop structure when you want to repeat a task a defined number of times is the for loop. The most basic example of a for loop is:\n\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\nBut what’s the code actually doing? This is a dynamic bit of code were an index i is iteratively replaced by each value in the vector 1:5. Let’s break it down. Because the first value in our sequence (1:5) is 1, the loop starts by replacing i with 1 and runs everything between the { }. Loops conventionally use i as the counter, short for iteration, but you are free to use whatever you like, even your pet’s name, it really does not matter (except when using nested loops, in which case the counters must be called different things, like SenorWhiskers and HerrFlufferkins.\nSo, if we were to do the first iteration of the loop manually\n\ni &lt;- 1\nprint(i)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nOnce this first iteration is complete, the for loop loops back to the beginning and replaces i with the next value in our 1:5 sequence (2 in this case):\n\ni &lt;- 2\nprint(i)\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThis process is then repeated until the loop reaches the final value in the sequence (5 in this example) after which point it stops.\nTo reinforce how for loops work and introduce you to a valuable feature of loops, we’ll alter our counter within the loop. This can be used, for example, if we’re using a loop to iterate through a vector but want to select the next row (or any other value). To show this we’ll simply add 1 to the value of our index every time we iterate our loop.\n\nfor (i in 1:5) {\n  print(i + 1)\n}\n\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n[1] 6\n\n\nAs in the previous loop, the first value in our sequence is 1. The loop begins by replacing i with 1, but this time we’ve specified that a value of 1 must be added to i in the expression resulting in a value of 1 + 1.\n\ni &lt;- 1\ni + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nAs before, once the iteration is complete, the loop moves onto the next value in the sequence and replaces i with the next value (2 in this case) so that i + 1 becomes 2 + 1.\n\ni &lt;- 2\ni + 1\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nAnd so on. We think you get the idea! In essence this is all a for loop is doing and nothing more.\nWhilst above we have been using simple addition in the body of the loop, you can also combine loops with functions.\nLet’s go back to our data frame city. Previously in the Chapter we created a function to multiply two columns and used it to create our porto_aberdeen, aberdeen_nairobi, and nairobi_genoa objects. We could have used a loop for this. Let’s remind ourselves what our data look like and the code for the multiple_columns() function.\n\n# Recreating our dataset\ncity &lt;- data.frame(\n  porto = rnorm(100),\n  aberdeen = rnorm(100),\n  nairobi = c(rep(NA, 10), rnorm(90)),\n  genoa = rnorm(100)\n)\n\n# Our function\nmultiply_columns &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  temp &lt;- x * y\n  if (any(is.na(temp))) {\n    warning(\"The function has produced NAs\")\n    return(temp)\n  } else {\n    return(temp)\n  }\n}\n\nTo use a list to iterate over these columns we need to first create an empty list (remember lists?) which we call temp (short for temporary) which will be used to store the output of the for loop.\n\ntemp &lt;- list()\nfor (i in 1:(ncol(city) - 1)) {\n  temp[[i]] &lt;- multiply_columns(x = city[, i], y = city[, i + 1])\n}\n\nWarning in multiply_columns(x = city[, i], y = city[, i + 1]): The function has\nproduced NAs\n\nWarning in multiply_columns(x = city[, i], y = city[, i + 1]): The function has\nproduced NAs\n\n\nWhen we specify our for loop notice how we subtracted 1 from ncol(city). The ncol() function returns the number of columns in our city data frame which is 4 and so our loop runs from i = 1 to i = 4 - 1 which is i = 3. We’ll come back to why we need to subtract 1 from this in a minute.\nSo in the first iteration of the loop i takes on the value 1. The multiply_columns() function multiplies the city[, 1] (porto) and city[, 1 + 1] (aberdeen) columns and stores it in the temp[[1]] which is the first element of the temp list.\nThe second iteration of the loop i takes on the value 2. The multiply_columns() function multiplies the city[, 2] (aberdeen) and city[, 2 + 1] (nairobi) columns and stores it in the temp[[2]] which is the second element of the temp list.\nThe third and final iteration of the loop i takes on the value 3. The multiply_columns() function multiplies the city[, 3] (nairobi) and city[, 3 + 1] (genoa) columns and stores it in the temp[[3]] which is the third element of the temp list.\nSo can you see why we used ncol(city) - 1 when we first set up our loop? As we have four columns in our city data frame if we didn’t use ncol(city) - 1 then eventually we’d try to add the 4th column with the non-existent 5th column.\nAgain, it’s a good idea to test that we are getting something sensible from our loop (remember, check, check and check again!). To do this we can use the identical() function to compare the variables we created by hand with each iteration of the loop manually.\n\nporto_aberdeen_func &lt;- multiply_columns(city$porto, city$aberdeen)\ni &lt;- 1\nidentical(multiply_columns(city[, i], city[, i + 1]), porto_aberdeen_func)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\naberdeen_nairobi_func &lt;- multiply_columns(city$aberdeen, city$nairobi)\n\nWarning in multiply_columns(city$aberdeen, city$nairobi): The function has\nproduced NAs\n\ni &lt;- 2\nidentical(multiply_columns(city[, i], city[, i + 1]), aberdeen_nairobi_func)\n\nWarning in multiply_columns(city[, i], city[, i + 1]): The function has\nproduced NAs\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nIf you can follow the examples above, you’ll be in a good spot to begin writing some of your own for loops. That said there are other types of loops available to you.\n\n6.5.2 While loop\nAnother type of loop that you may use (albeit less frequently) is the while loop. The while loop is used when you want to keep looping until a specific logical condition is satisfied (contrast this with the for loop which will always iterate through an entire sequence).\nThe basic structure of the while loop is:\n\nwhile(logical_condition){ expression }\n\nA simple example of a while loop is:\n\ni &lt;- 0\nwhile (i &lt;= 4) {\n  i &lt;- i + 1\n  print(i)\n}\n\n[1] 1\n[1] 2\n[1] 3\n[1] 4\n[1] 5\n\n\nHere the loop will only continue to pass values to the main body of the loop (the expression body) when i is less than or equal to 4 (specified using the &lt;= operator in this example). Once i is greater than 4 the loop will stop.\nThere is another, very rarely used type of loop; the repeat loop. The repeat loop has no conditional check so can keep iterating indefinitely (meaning a break, or “stop here”, has to be coded into it). It’s worthwhile being aware of it’s existence, but for now we don’t think you need to worry about it; the for and while loops will see you through the vast majority of your looping needs.\n\n6.5.3 When to use a loop?\nLoops are fairly commonly used, though sometimes a little overused in our opinion. Equivalent tasks can be performed with functions, which are often more efficient than loops. Though this raises the question when should you use a loop?\nIn general loops are implemented inefficiently in R and should be avoided when better alternatives exist, especially when you’re working with large datasets. However, loop are sometimes the only way to achieve the result we want.\nSome examples of when using loops can be appropriate:\n\nSome simulations (e.g. the Ricker model can, in part, be built using loops)\nRecursive relationships (a relationship which depends on the value of the previous relationship [“to understand recursion, you must understand recursion”])\nMore complex problems (e.g., how long since the last badger was seen at site \\(j\\), given a pine marten was seen at time \\(t\\), at the same location \\(j\\) as the badger, where the pine marten was detected in a specific 6 hour period, but exclude badgers seen 30 minutes before the pine marten arrival, repeated for all pine marten detections)\nWhile loops (keep jumping until you’ve reached the moon)\n\n6.5.4 If not loops, then what?\nIn short, use the apply family of functions; apply(), lapply(), tapply(), sapply(), vapply(), and mapply(). The apply functions can often do the tasks of most “home-brewed” loops, sometimes faster (though that won’t really be an issue for most people) but more importantly with a much lower risk of error. A strategy to have in the back of your mind which may be useful is; for every loop you make, try to remake it using an apply function (often lapply or sapply will work). If you can, use the apply version. There’s nothing worse than realising there was a small, tiny, seemingly meaningless mistake in a loop which weeks, months or years down the line has propagated into a huge mess. We strongly recommend trying to use the apply functions whenever possible.\nlapply\nYour go to apply function will often be lapply() at least in the beginning. The way that lapply() works, and the reason it is often a good alternative to for loops, is that it will go through each element in a list and perform a task (i.e. run a function). It has the added benefit that it will output the results as a list - something you’d have to otherwise code yourself into a loop.\nAn lapply() has the following structure:\n\nlapply(X, FUN)\n\nHere X is the vector which we want to do something to. FUN stands for how much fun this is (just kidding!). It’s also short for “function”.\nLet’s start with a simple demonstration first. Let’s use the lapply() function create a sequence from 1 to 5 and add 1 to each observation (just like we did when we used a for loop):\n\nlapply(0:4, function(a) {a + 1})\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 5\n\n\nNotice that we need to specify our sequence as 0:4 to get the output 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 , 5 as we are adding 1 to each element of the sequence. See what happens if you use 1:5 instead.\nEquivalently, we could have defined the function first and then used the function in lapply()\n\nadd_fun &lt;- function(a) {a + 1}\nlapply(0:4, add_fun)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 1\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 2\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 4\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 5\n\n\nThe sapply() function does the same thing as lapply() but instead of storing the results as a list, it stores them as a vector.\n\nsapply(0:4, function(a) {a + 1})\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\n\nAs you can see, in both cases, we get exactly the same results as when we used the for loop.",

A markup language simply provides a way of creating an easy to read plain text file which can incorporate formatted text, images, headers and links to other documents. Don’t worry about the details for the moment, although if you’re interested you can find more information about markup languages here. Actually, if it makes you feel any better all of you will have been exposed to a markup language before, as most of the internet content you digest every day is underpinned by a markup language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). Anyway, the main point is that R markdown is very easy to learn (much, much easier than HTML) and when used with RStudio it’s ridiculously easy to integrate into your workflow to produce feature rich content (so why wouldn’t you?!).",

    "text": "7.2 Why use R markdown?\nDuring the previous Chapters we talked a lot about conducting your research in a robust and reproducible manner to facilitate open science. In a nutshell, open science is about doing all we can to make our data, methods, results and inferences transparent and available to everyone. Some of the main tenets of open science are described here and include:\n\nTransparency in experimental methodology, observation, collection of data and analytical methods.\nPublic availability and re-usability of scientific data\nPublic accessibility and transparency of scientific communication\nUsing web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration\n\nBy now all of you will (hopefully) be using R to explore and analyse your interesting data. As such, you’re already well along the road to making your analysis more reproducible, transparent and shareable. However, perhaps your current workflow looks something like this:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYour data is imported from your favourite spreadsheet software into RStudio (or R), you write your R code to explore and analyse your data, you save plots as external files, copy tables of analysis output and then manually combine all of this and your written prose into a single MS Word document (maybe a paper or thesis chapter). Whilst there is nothing particularly wrong with this approach (and it’s certainly better than using point and click software to analyse your data) there are some limitations:\n\nIt’s not particularly reproducible. Because this workflow separates your R code from the final document there are multiple opportunities for undocumented decisions to be made (which plots did you use? what analysis did/didn’t you include? etc).\nIt’s inefficient. If you need to go back and change something (create a new plot or update your analysis etc) you will need to create or amend multiple documents increasing the risk of mistakes creeping into your workflow.\nIt’s difficult to maintain. If your analysis changes you again need to update multiple files and documents.\nIt can be difficult to decide what to share with others. Do you share all of your code (initial data exploration, model validation etc) or just the code specific to your final document? It’s quite a common (and bad!) practice for researchers to maintain two R scripts, one used for the actual analysis and one to share with the final paper or thesis chapter. This can be both time consuming and confusing and should be avoided.\n\nPerhaps a more efficient and robust workflow would look something like this:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYour data is imported into RStudio (or R) as before but this time all of the R code you used to analyse your data, produce your plots and your written text (Introduction, Materials and Methods, Discussion etc) is contained within a single R markdown document which is then used (along with your data) to automatically create your final document. This is exactly what R markdown allows you to do.\nSome of the advantages of using R markdown include:\n\nExplicitly links your data with your R code and output creating a fully reproducible workflow. ALL of the R code used to explore, summarise and analyse your data can be included in a single easy to read document. You can decide what to include in your final document (as you will learn below) but all of your R code can be included in the R markdown document.\nYou can create a wide variety of output formats (pdf, html web pages, MS Word and many others) from a single R markdown document which enhances both collaboration and communication.\nEnhances transparency of your research. Your data and R markdown file can be included with your publication or thesis chapter as supplementary material or hosted on a GitHub repository (see the GitHub Chapter).\nIncreases the efficiency of your workflow. If you need to modify or extend your current analysis you just need to update your R markdown document and these changes will automatically be included in your final document.",

In the pop up window, give the document a ‘Title’ and enter the ‘Author’ information (your name) and select HTML as the default output. We can change all of this later so don’t worry about it for the moment.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou will notice that when your new R markdown document is created it includes some example R markdown code. Normally you would just highlight and delete everything in the document except the information at the top between the --- delimiters (this is called the YAML header which we will discuss in a bit) and then start writing your own code. However, just for now we will use this document to practice converting R markdown to both html and pdf formats and check everything is working.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOnce you’ve created your R markdown document it’s good practice to save this file somewhere convenient. You can do this by selecting File -&gt; Save from RStudio menu (or use the keyboard shortcut ctrl + s on Windows or cmd + s on a Mac) and enter an appropriate file name (maybe call it my_first_rmarkdown). Notice the file extension of your new R markdown file is .Rmd.\nNow, to convert your .Rmd file to a HTML document click on the little black triangle next to the Knit icon at the top of the source window and select knit to HTML\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRStudio will now ‘knit’ (or render) your .Rmd file into a HTML file. Notice that there is a new R Markdown tab in your console window which provides you with information on the rendering process and will also display any errors if something goes wrong.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf everything went smoothly a new HTML file will have been created and saved in the same directory as your .Rmd file (ours will be called my_first_rmarkdown.html). To view this document simply double click on the file to open in a browser (like Chrome or Firefox) to display the rendered content. RStudio will also display a preview of the rendered file in a new window for you to check out (your window might look slightly different if you’re using a Windows computer).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGreat, you’ve just rendered your first R markdown document. If you want to knit your .Rmd file to a pdf document then all you need to do is choose knit to PDF instead of knit to HTML when you click on the knit icon. This will create a file called my_first_rmarkdown.pdf which you can double click to open. Give it a go!\nYou can also knit an .Rmd file using the command line in the console rather than by clicking on the knit icon. To do this, just use the render() function from the rmarkdown package as shown below. Again, you can change the output format using the output_format= argument as well as many other options.\n \n\nlibrary(rmarkdown)\n\nrender('my_first_rmarkdown.Rmd', output_format = 'html_document')\n\n# alternatively if you don't want to load the rmarkdown package\n\nrmarkdown::render('my_first_rmarkdown.Rmd', output_format = 'html_document')\n\n# see ?render for more options",

    "text": "7.5 R markdown anatomy\nOK, now that you can render an R markdown file in RStudio into both HTML and pdf formats let’s take a closer look at the different components of a typical R markdown document. Normally each R markdown document is composed of 3 main components, 1) a YAML header, 2) formatted text and 3) one or more code chunks.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n7.5.1 YAML header\nYAML stands for ‘YAML Ain’t Markup Language’ (it’s an ‘in’ joke!) and this optional component contains the metadata and options for the entire document such as the author name, date, output format, etc. The YAML header is surrounded before and after by a --- on its own line. In RStudio a minimal YAML header is automatically created for you when you create a new R markdown document as we did above but you can change this any time. A simple YAML header may look something like this:\n---\ntitle: My first R markdown document\nauthor: Jane Doe\ndate: March 01, 2020\noutput: html_document\n---\nIn the YAML header above the output format is set to HTML. If you would like to change the output to pdf format then you can change it from output: html_document to output: pdf_document (you can also set more than one output format if you like). You can also change the default font and font size for the whole document and even include fancy options such as a table of contents and inline references and a bibliography. If you want to explore the plethora of other options see here. Just a note of caution, many of the options you can specify in the YAML header will work with both HTML and pdf formatted documents, but not all. If you need multiple output formats for your R markdown document check whether your YAML options are compatible between these formats. Also, indentation in the YAML header has a meaning, so be careful when aligning text. For example, if you want to include a table of contents you would modify the output: field in the YAML header as follows\n---\ntitle: My first R markdown document\nauthor: Jane Doe\ndate: March 01, 2020\noutput:\n  html_document:\n    toc: yes\n---\n\n7.5.2 Formatted text\nAs mentioned above, one of the great things about R markdown is that you don’t need to rely on your word processor to bring your R code, analysis and writing together. R markdown is able to render (almost) all of the text formatting that you are likely to need such as italics, bold, strike-through, super and subscript as well as bulleted and numbered lists, headers and footers, images, links to other documents or web pages and also equations. However, in contrast to your familiar What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) word processing software you don’t see the final formatted text in your R markdown document (as you would in MS Word), rather you need to ‘markup’ the formatting in your text ready to be rendered in your output document. At first, this might seem like a right pain in the proverbial but it’s actually very easy to do and also has many advantages (do you find yourself spending more time on making your text look pretty in MS Word rather than writing good content?!).\nHere is an example of marking up text formatting in an R markdown document\n#### Benthic Biodiversity experiment\nThese data were obtained from a mesocosm experiment which aimed to examine the effect \nof benthic polychaete (*Nereis diversicolor*) biomass on sediment nutrient \n(NH~4~, NO~3~ and PO~3~) release. At the start of the experiment 15 replicate mesocosms \nwere filled with 20 cm^2^ of **homogenised** marine sediment and assigned to one of five \npolychaete biomass treatments (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 g per mesocosm).\nwhich would look like this in the final rendered document (can you spot the markups?)\n\nBenthic Biodiversity experiment\n\n\nThese data were obtained from a mesocosm experiment which aimed to examine the effect of benthic polychaete (Nereis diversicolor) biomass on sediment nutrient (NH4, NO3 and PO3) release. At the start of the experiment replicate mesocosms were filled with 20 cm2 of homogenised marine sediment and assigned to one of five polychaete biomass treatments (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 g per mesocosm).\n\nEmphasis\nSome of the most common R markdown syntax for providing emphasis and formatting text is given below.\n \n\n\nGoal\nR markdown\noutput\n\n\n\nbold text\n**mytext**\nmytext\n\n\nitalic text\n*mytext*\nmytext\n\n\nstrikethrough\n~~mytext~~\nmytext\n\n\nsuperscript\nmytext^2^\nmytext2\n\n\n\nsubscript\nmytext~2~\nmytext2\n\n\n\n\n \nInterestingly there is no underline R markdown syntax by default. We think this is because bold and italics are used to emphasise content (a semantic meaning) whereas an underline is considered a stylistic element (there may well be other reasons). If you really want to underline text you can use &lt;span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"&gt;underline this text&lt;/span&gt; for HTML output or $\\text{\\underline{This sentence underlined using \\LaTeX}}$ for pdf output. We just avoid underlining!\nWhite space and line breaks\nOne of the things that can be confusing for new users of R markdown is the use of spaces and carriage returns (the enter key on your keyboard). In R markdown multiple spaces within the text are generally ignored as are carriage returns. For example this R markdown text\nThese      data were      obtained from a\nmesocosm experiment which    aimed to examine the\neffect\nof          benthic polychaete (*Nereis diversicolor*) biomass.\nwill be rendered as\n\nThese data were obtained from a mesocosm experiment which aimed to examine the effect of benthic polychaete (Nereis diversicolor) biomass.\n\nThis is generally a good thing (no more random multiple spaces in your text). If you want your text to start on a new line then you can simply add two blank spaces at the end of the preceding line\n\nThese data were obtained from a\nmesocosm experiment which aimed to examine the\neffect benthic polychaete (Nereis diversicolor) biomass.\n\nIf you really want multiple spaces within your text then you can use the Non breaking space tag &nbsp;\nThese &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; data were &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; obtained from a  \nmesocosm experiment which &nbsp; &nbsp; aimed to examine the    \neffect &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; benthic polychaete (*Nereis diversicolor*) biomass.\n\nThese       data were         obtained from a\nmesocosm experiment which     aimed to examine the\neffect         benthic polychaete (Nereis diversicolor) biomass.\n\nHeadings\nYou can add headings and subheadings to your R markdown document by using the # symbol at the beginning of the line. You can decrease the size of the headings by simply adding more # symbols. For example\n# Benthic Biodiversity experiment\n## Benthic Biodiversity experiment\n### Benthic Biodiversity experiment\n#### Benthic Biodiversity experiment\n##### Benthic Biodiversity experiment\n###### Benthic Biodiversity experiment\nresults in headings in decreasing size order\n\n\nBenthic Biodiversity experiment\nBenthic Biodiversity experiment\nBenthic Biodiversity experiment\nBenthic Biodiversity experiment\nBenthic Biodiversity experiment\nBenthic Biodiversity experiment\n\n\nComments\nAs you can see above the meaning of the # symbol is different when formatting text in an R markdown document compared to a standard R script (which is used to included a comment - remember?!). You can, however, use a # symbol to comment code inside a code chunk as usual (more about this in a bit). If you want to include a comment in your R markdown document outside a code chunk which won’t be included in the final rendered document then enclose your comment between &lt;!-- and --&gt;.\n&lt;!--\nthis is an example of how to format a comment using R markdown.\n--&gt;\nLists\nIf you want to create a bullet point list of text you can format an unordered list with sub items. Notice that the sub-items need to be indented.\n- item 1\n- item 2\n   + sub-item 2\n   + sub-item 3\n- item 3\n- item 4\n \n\n\nitem 1\nitem 2\n\nsub-item 2\nsub-item 3\n\n\nitem 3\nitem 4\n\n\n \nIf you need an ordered list\n\n1. item 1\n2. item 2\n     + sub-item 2\n     + sub-item 3\n3. item 3\n4. item 4\n \n\n\nitem 1\nitem 2\n\nsub-item 2\nsub-item 3\n\n\nitem 3\nitem 4\n\n\nImages\nAnother useful feature is the ability to embed images and links to web pages (or other documents) into your R markdown document. You can include images into your R markdown document in a number of different ways. Perhaps the simplest method is to use\n![Cute grey kitten](images/Cute_grey_kitten.jpg)\nresulting in:\n\n\nCute grey kitten\n\nThe code above will only work if the image file (Cute_grey_kitten.jpg) is in the right place relative to where you saved your .Rmd file. In the example above the image file is in a sub directory (folder) called images in the directory where we saved our my_first_rmarkdown.Rmd file. You can embed images saved in many different file types but perhaps the most common are .jpg and .png.\nWe think a more flexible way of including images in your document is to use the include_graphics() function from the knitr package as this gives finer control over the alignment and image size (it also works more or less the same with both HTML and pdf output formats). However, to do this you will need to include this R code in a ‘code chunk’ which we haven’t covered yet. Despite this we’ll leave the code here for later reference. This code center aligns the image and scales it to 50% of it’s original size. See ?include_graphics for more options.\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='50%'}\nlibrary(knitr)\ninclude_graphics(\"images/Cute_grey_kitten.jpg\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks\nIn addition to images you can also include links to webpages or other links in your document. Use the following syntax to create a clickable link to an existing webpage. The link text goes between the square brackets and the URL for the webpage between the round brackets immediately after.\nYou can include a text for your clickable [link](https://www.worldwildlife.org)\nwhich gives you:\n\nYou can include a text for your clickable link\n\n\n7.5.3 Code chunks\nNow to the heart of the matter. To include R code into your R markdown document you simply place your code into a ‘code chunk’. All code chunks start and end with three backticks ```. Note, these are also known as ‘grave accents’ or ‘back quotes’ and are not the same as an apostrophe! On most keyboards you can find the backtick on the same key as tilde (~).\n```{r}\nAny valid R code goes here\n```\nYou can insert a code chunk by either typing the chunk delimiters ```{r} and ``` manually or use the RStudio toolbar (the Insert button) or by clicking on the menu Code -&gt; Insert Chunk. Perhaps an even better way is to get familiar with the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl + Alt + I for Windows and Cmd + Option + I on MacOSX.\nThere are a many things you can do with code chunks: you can produce text output from your analysis, create tables and figures and insert images amongst other things. Within the code chunk you can place rules and arguments between the curly brackets {} that give you control over how your code is interpreted and output is rendered. These are known as chunk options. The only mandatory chunk option is the first argument which specifies which language you’re using (r in our case but other languages are supported). Note, all of your chunk options must be written between the curly brackets on one line with no line breaks.\nYou can also specify an optional code chunk name (or label) which can be useful when trying to debug problems and when performing advanced document rendering. In the following block we name the code chunk summary-stats, create a dataframe (dataf) with two variables x and y and then use the summary() function to display some summary statistics . When we run the code chunk both the R code and the resulting output are displayed in the final document.\n```{r, summary-stats}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n\nsummary(dataf)\n```\n\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n\nsummary(dataf)\n\n       x               y        \n Min.   : 1.00   Min.   : 1.00  \n 1st Qu.: 3.25   1st Qu.: 3.25  \n Median : 5.50   Median : 5.50  \n Mean   : 5.50   Mean   : 5.50  \n 3rd Qu.: 7.75   3rd Qu.: 7.75  \n Max.   :10.00   Max.   :10.00  \n\n\nWhen using chunk names make sure that you don’t have duplicate chunk names in your R markdown document and avoid spaces and full stops as this may cause problems when you come to knit your document (We use a - to separate words in our chunk names).\nIf we wanted to only display the output of our R code (just the summary statistics for example) and not the code itself in our final document we can use the chunk option echo=FALSE\n```{r, summary-stats, echo=FALSE}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nsummary(dataf)\n```\n\n\n       x               y        \n Min.   : 1.00   Min.   : 1.00  \n 1st Qu.: 3.25   1st Qu.: 3.25  \n Median : 5.50   Median : 5.50  \n Mean   : 5.50   Mean   : 5.50  \n 3rd Qu.: 7.75   3rd Qu.: 7.75  \n Max.   :10.00   Max.   :10.00  \n\n\nTo display the R code but not the output use the results='hide' chunk option.\n```{r, summary-stats, results='hide'}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nsummary(dataf)\n```\n\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nsummary(dataf)\n\nSometimes you may want to execute a code chunk without showing any output at all. You can suppress the entire output using the chunk option include=FALSE.\n```{r, summary-stats, include=FALSE}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nsummary(dataf)\n```\nThere are a large number of chunk options documented here with a more condensed version here. Perhaps the most commonly used are summarised below with the default values shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChunk option\ndefault value\nFunction\n\n\n\necho\necho=TRUE\nIf FALSE, will not display the code in the final document\n\n\nresults\nresults='markup'\nIf ‘hide’, will not display the code’s results in the final document. If ‘hold’, will delay displaying all output pieces until the end of the chunk. If ‘asis’, will pass through results without reformatting them.\n\n\ninclude\ninclude=TRUE\nIf FALSE, will run the chunk but not include the chunk in the final document.\n\n\neval\neval=TRUE\nIf FALSE, will not run the code in the code chunk.\n\n\nmessage\nmessage=TRUE\nIf FALSE, will not display any messages generated by the code.\n\n\nwarning\nwarning=TRUE\nIf FALSE, will not display any warning messages generated by the code.\n\n\n\n7.5.4 Adding figures\nBy default, figures produced by R code will be placed immediately after the code chunk they were generated from. For example:\n```{r, simple-plot}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n```\n\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to change the plot dimensions in the final document you can use the fig.width= and fig.height= chunk options (in inches!). You can also change the alignment of the figure using the fig.align= chunk option.\n```{r, simple-plot, fig.width=4, fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n```\n\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can add a figure caption using the fig.cap= option.\n```{r, simple-plot-cap, fig.cap=\"A simple plot\", fig.align='center'}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n```\n\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n\n\n\nA simple plot\n\n\n\n \nIf you want to suppress the figure in the final document use the fig.show='hide' option.\n```{r, simple-plot, fig.show='hide'}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n```\n\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\nplot(dataf$x, dataf$y, xlab = \"x axis\", ylab = \"y axis\")\n\n \nIf you’re using a package like ggplot2 to create your plots then don’t forget you will need to make the package available with the library() function in the code chunk (or in a preceding code chunk).\n```{r, simple-ggplot}\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(dataf, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nx &lt;- 1:10    # create an x variable\ny &lt;- 10:1    # create a y variable\ndataf &lt;- data.frame(x = x, y = y)\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(dataf, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAgain, there are a large number of chunk options specific to producing plots and figures. See here for more details.\n\n7.5.5 Adding tables\nR markdown can print the contents of a dataframe as a table (or any other tabular object such as a summary of model output) by including the name of the dataframe in a code chunk. For example, to create a table of the first 10 rows of the inbuilt dataset iris\n```{r, ugly-table}\niris[1:10,]\n```\n\n\n   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n1           5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa\n2           4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa\n3           4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa\n4           4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa\n5           5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa\n6           5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa\n7           4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3  setosa\n8           5.0         3.4          1.5         0.2  setosa\n9           4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2  setosa\n10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1  setosa\n\n\nBut how ugly is that! You can create slightly nicer looking tables using native markdown syntax (this doesn’t need to be in a code chunk).\n \n    |     x      |    y       |\n    |:----------:|:----------:|\n    |  1         |   5        |   \n    |  2         |   4        |\n    |  3         |   3        |\n    |  4         |   2        |\n    |  5         |   1        |\n \n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n1\n5\n\n\n2\n4\n\n\n3\n3\n\n\n4\n2\n\n\n5\n1\n\n\n\n \nThe :-------: lets R markdown know that the line above should be treated as a header and the lines below as the body of the table. Alignment within the table is set by the position of the :. To center align use :------:, to left align :------ and right align ------:. Whilst it can be fun(!) to create tables with raw markup it’s only practical for very small and simple tables.\nThe easiest way we know to include tables in an R markdown document is by using the kable() function from the knitr package (this should have already been installed when you installed the rmarkdown package). The kable() function can create tables for HTML, PDF and Word outputs.\nTo create a table of the first 10 rows of the iris dataframe using the kable() function simply write your code block as\n```{r, kable-table}\nlibrary(knitr)\nkable(iris[1:10,])\n```\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.4\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.4\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.4\n2.9\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.1\n1.5\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kable() function offers plenty of options to change the formatting of the table. For example, if we want to round numeric values to one decimal place use the digits = argument. To center justify the table contents use align = 'c' and to provide custom column headings use the col.names = argument. See ?knitr::kable for more information.\n```{r, kable-table2}\nkable(iris[1:10,], digits = 0, align = 'c', \n       col.names = c('sepal length', 'sepal width', \n       'petal length', 'petal width', 'species'))\n```\n\n\n\n\nsepal length\nsepal width\npetal length\npetal width\nspecies\n\n\n\n5\n4\n1\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n3\n1\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n3\n1\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n3\n2\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n4\n1\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n4\n2\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n3\n1\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n3\n2\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n4\n3\n1\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n5\n3\n2\n0\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can further enhance the look of your kable tables using the kableExtra package (don’t forget to install the package first!). See here for more details and a helpful tutorial.\n```{r, kableExtra-table}\nlibrary(kableExtra)\nkable(iris[1:10,]) %&gt;%\n    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = \"striped\", font_size = 10)\n```\n\n\n\n\nSepal.Length\nSepal.Width\nPetal.Length\nPetal.Width\nSpecies\n\n\n\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.0\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.1\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.6\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n5.4\n3.9\n1.7\n0.4\nsetosa\n\n\n4.6\n3.4\n1.4\n0.3\nsetosa\n\n\n5.0\n3.4\n1.5\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.4\n2.9\n1.4\n0.2\nsetosa\n\n\n4.9\n3.1\n1.5\n0.1\nsetosa\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you want even more control and customisation options for your tables take a look at the pander and xtable packages.\n\n7.5.6 Inline R code\nUp till now we’ve been writing and executing our R code in code chunks. Another great reason to use R markdown is that we can also include our R code directly within our text. This is known as ‘inline code’. To include your code in your R markdown text you simply write `r write your code here`. This can come in really useful when you want to include summary statistics within your text. For example, we could describe the iris dataset as follows:\nMorphological characteristics (variable names:  `r names(iris)[1:4]`) were measured from   \n`r nrow(iris)` *Iris sp.* plants from  `r length(levels(iris$Species))` different  \nspecies. The mean Sepal length was `r round(mean(iris$Sepal.Length), digits = 2)` mm.   \nwhich will be rendered as\n\nMorphological characteristics (variable names: Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width) were measured from 150 iris plants from 3 different species. The mean Sepal length was 5.84 mm.\n\nThe great thing about including inline R code in your text is that these values will automatically be updated if your data changes.",

To put it another way, if you muck things up or accidentally lose important files you can easily roll back to a previous stage in your project to sort things out. Version control was originally designed for collaborative software development, but it’s equally useful for scientific research and collaborations (although admittedly a lot of the terms, jargon and functionality are focused on the software development side). There are many different version control systems currently available, but we’ we’ll focus on using Git, because it’s free and open source and it integrates nicely with RStudio.

    "text": "8.3 What is Git and GitHub?\nGit is a version control system originally developed by Linus Torvalds that lets you track changes to a set of files. These files can be any type of file including the menagerie of files that typically make up a data orientated project (.pdf, .Rmd, .docx, .txt, .jpg etc) although plain text files work the best. All the files that make up a project is called a repository (or just repo).\nGitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories which allows you to create a remote copy of your local version-controlled project. This can be used as a backup or archive of your project or make it accessible to you and to your colleagues so you can work collaboratively.\nAt the start of a project we typically (but not always) create a remote repository on GitHub, then clone (think of this as copying) this repository to our local computer (the one in front of you). This cloning is usually a one time event and you shouldn’t need to clone this repository again unless you really muck things up. Once you have cloned your repository you can then work locally on your project as usual, creating and saving files for your data analysis (scripts, R markdown documents, figures etc). Along the way you can take snapshots (called commits) of these files after you’ve made important changes. We can then push these changes to the remote GitHub repository to make a backup or make available to our collaborators. If other people are working on the same project (repository), or maybe you’re working on a different computer, you can pull any changes back to your local repository so everything is synchronised.",

    "text": "8.4 Getting started\nThis Chapter assumes that you have already installed the latest versions of R and an IDE (RStudio or VSCode). If you haven’t done this yet you can find instructions here.\n\n8.4.1 Install Git\nTo get started, you first need to install Git. If you’re lucky you may already have Git installed (especially if you have a Mac or Linux computer). You can check if you already have Git installed by clicking on the Terminal tab in the Console window in RStudio and typing git --version (the space after the git command is important). If you see something that looks like git version 2.25.0 (the version number may be different on your computer) then you already have Git installed (happy days). If you get an error (something like git: command not found) this means you don’t have Git installed (yet!).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can also do this check outside RStudio by opening up a separate Terminal if you want. On Windows go to the ‘Start menu’ and in the search bar (or run box) type cmd and press enter. On a Mac go to ‘Applications’ in Finder, click on the ‘Utilities’ folder and then on the ‘Terminal’ program. On a Linux machine simply open the Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T often does it).\nTo install Git on a Windows computer we recommend you download and install Git for Windows (also known as ‘Git Bash’). You can find the download file and installation instructions here.\nFor those of you using a Mac computer we recommend you download Git from here and install in the usual way (double click on the installer package once downloaded). If you’ve previously installed Xcode on your Mac and want to use a more up to date version of Git then you will need to follow a few more steps documented here. If you’ve never heard of Xcode then don’t worry about it!\nFor those of you lucky enough to be working on a Linux machine you can simply use your OS package manager to install Git from the official repository. For Ubuntu Linux (or variants of) open your Terminal and type\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install git\nYou will need administrative privileges to do this. For other versions of Linux see here for further installation instructions.\nWhatever version of Git you’re installing, once the installation has finished verify that the installation process has been successful by running the command git --version in the Terminal tab in RStudio (as described above). On some installations of Git (yes we’re looking at you MS Windows) this may still produce an error as you will also need to setup RStudio so it can find the Git executable (described below).\n\n8.4.2 Configure Git\nAfter installing Git, you need to configure it so you can use it. Click on the Terminal tab in the Console window again and type the following:\ngit config --global user.email 'you@youremail.com'\n\ngit config --global user.name 'Your Name'\nsubstituting 'Your Name' for your actual name and 'you@youremail.com' with your email address. We recommend you use your University email address (if you have one) as you will also use this address when you register for your GitHub account (coming up in a bit).\nIf this was successful, you should see no error messages from these commands. To verify that you have successfully configured Git type the following into the Terminal\ngit config --global --list\nYou should see both your user.name and user.email configured.\n\n8.4.3 Configure RStudio\nAs you can see above, Git can be used from the command line, but it also integrates well with RStudio, providing a friendly graphical user interface. If you want to use RStudio’s Git integration (we recommend you do - at least at the start), you need to check that the path to the Git executable is specified correctly. In RStudio, go to the menu Tools -&gt; Global Options -&gt; Git/SVN and make sure that ‘Enable version control interface for RStudio projects’ is ticked and that the ‘Git executable:’ path is correct for your installation. If it’s not correct hit the Browse... button and navigate to where you installed git and click on the executable file. You will need to restart RStudio after doing this.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.4 Configure VSCode\n\nto develop\n\n\n8.4.5 Register a GitHub account\nIf all you want to do is to keep track of files and file versions on your local computer then Git is sufficient. If however, you would like to make an off-site copy of your project or make it available to your collaborators then you will need a web-based hosting service for your Git repositories. This is where GitHub comes into play (there are also other services like GitLab, Bitbucket and Savannah). You can sign up for a free account on GitHub here. You will need to specify a username, an email address and a strong password. We suggest that you use your University email address (if you have one) as this will also allow you to apply for a free educator or researcher account later on which gives you some useful benefits (don’t worry about this now though). When it comes to choosing a username we suggest you give this some thought. Choose a short(ish) rather than a long username, use all lowercase and hyphenate if you want to include multiple words, find a way of incorporating your actual name and lastly, choose a username that you will feel comfortable revealing to your future employer!\nNext click on the ‘Select a plan’ (you may have to solve a simple puzzle first to verify you’re human) and choose the ‘Free Plan’ option. Github will send an email to the email address you supplied for you to verify.\nOnce you’ve completed all those steps you should have both Git and GitHub setup up ready for you to use (Finally!).",

    "text": "8.5 Setting up a project\n\n8.5.1 in RStudio\nNow that you’re all set up, let’s create your first version controlled RStudio project. There are a couple of different approaches you can use to do this. You can either setup a remote GitHub repository first then connect an RStudio project to this repository (we’ll call this Option 1). Another option is to setup a local repository first and then link a remote GitHub repository to this repository (Option 2). You can also connect an existing project to a GitHub repository but we won’t cover this here. We suggest that if you’re completely new to Git and GitHub then use Option 1 as this approach sets up your local Git repository nicely and you can push and pull immediately. Option 2 requires a little more work and therefore there are more opportunities to go wrong. We will cover both of these options below.\n\n8.5.2 Option 1 - GitHub first\nTo use the GitHub first approach you will first need to create a repository (repo) on GitHub. Go to your GitHub page and sign in if necessary. Click on the ‘Repositories’ tab at the top and then on the green ‘New’ button on the right\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nGive your new repo a name (let’s call it first_repo for this Chapter), select ‘Public’, tick on the ‘Initialize this repository with a README’ (this is important) and then click on ‘Create repository’ (ignore the other options for now).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYour new GitHub repository will now be created. Notice the README has been rendered in GitHub and is in markdown (.md) format (see Chapter 8 on R markdown if this doesn’t mean anything to you). Next click on the green ‘Clone or Download’ button and copy the https//... URL that pops up for later (either highlight it all and copy or click on the copy to clipboard icon to the right).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOk, we now switch our attention to RStudio. In RStudio click on the File -&gt; New Project menu. In the pop up window select Version Control.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow paste the the URL you previously copied from GitHub into the Repository URL: box. This should then automatically fill out the Project Directory Name: section with the correct repository name (it’s important that the name of this directory has the same name as the repository you created in GitHub). You can then select where you want to create this directory by clicking on the Browse button opposite the Create project as a subdirectory of: option. Navigate to where you want the directory created and click OK. We also tick the Open in new session option.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRStudio will now create a new directory with the same name as your repository on your local computer and will then clone your remote repository to this directory. The directory will contain three new files; first_repo.Rproj (or whatever you called your repository), README.md and .gitignore. You can check this out in the Files tab usually in the bottom right pane in RStudio. You will also have a Git tab in the top right pane with two files listed (we will come to this later on in the Chapter). That’s it for Option 1, you now have a remote GitHub repository set up and this is linked to your local repository managed by RStudio. Any changes you make to files in this directory will be version controlled by Git.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.5.3 Option 2 - RStudio first\nAn alternative approach is to create a local RStudio project first and then link to a remote Github repository. As we mentioned before, this option is more involved than Option 1 so feel free to skip this now and come back later to it if you’re interested. This option is also useful if you just want to create a local RStudio project linked to a local Git repository (i.e. no GitHub involved). If you want to do this then just follow the instructions below omitting the GitHub bit.\n \nIn RStudio click on the File -&gt; New Project menu and select the New Directory option.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the pop up window select the New Project option\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIn the New Project window specify a Directory name (choose second_repo for this Chapter) and select where you would like to create this directory on you computer (click the Browse button). Make sure the Create a git repository option is ticked\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis will create a version controlled directory called second_repo on your computer that contains two files, second_repo.Rproj and .gitignore (there might also be a .Rhistory file but ignore this). You can check this by looking in the Files tab in RStudio (usually in the bottom right pane).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOK, before we go on to create a repository on GitHub we need to do one more thing - we need to place our second_repo.Rproj and .gitignorefiles under version control. Unfortunately we haven’t covered this in detail yet so just follow the next few instructions (blindly!) and we’ll revisit them in the Using Git section of this Chapter.\nTo get our two files under version control click on the ‘Git’ tab which is usually in the top tight pane in RStudio\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can see that both files are listed. Next, tick the boxes under the ‘Staged’ column for both files and then click on the ‘Commit’ button.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis will take you to the ‘Review Changes’ window. Type in the commit message ‘First commit’ in the ‘Commit message’ window and click on the ‘Commit’ button. A new window will appear with some messages which you can ignore for now. Click ‘Close’ to close this window and also close the ‘Review Changes’ window. The two files should now have disappeared from the Git pane in RStudio indicating a successful commit.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOK, that’s those two files now under version control. Now we need to create a new repository on GitHub. In your browser go to your GitHub page and sign in if necessary. Click on the ‘Repositories’ tab and then click on the green ‘New’ button on the right. Give your new repo the name second_repo (the same as your version controlled directory name) and select ‘Public’. This time do not tick the ‘Initialize this repository with a README’ (this is important) and then click on ‘Create repository’.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis will take you to a Quick setup page which provides you with some code for various situations. The code we are interested in is the code under ...or push an existing repository from the command line heading.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nHighlight and copy the first line of code (note: yours will be slightly different as it will include your GitHub username not mine)\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/alexd106/second_repo.git\nSwitch to RStudio, click on the ‘Terminal’ tab and paste the command into the Terminal. Now go back to GitHub and copy the second line of code\ngit push -u origin master\nand paste this into the Terminal in RStudio. You should see something like this\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you take a look at your repo back on GitHub (click on the /second_repo link at the top) you will see the second_repo.Rproj and .gitignore files have now been pushed to GitHub from your local repository.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe last thing we need to do is create and add a README file to your repository. A README file describes your project and is written using the same Markdown language you learned in the R markdown Chapter. A good README file makes it easy for others (or the future you!) to use your code and reproduce your project. You can create a README file in RStudio or in GitHub. Let’s use the second option.\nIn your repository on GitHub click on the green Add a README button.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow write a short description of your project in the &lt;&gt; Edit new file section and then click on the green Commit new file button.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou should now see the README.md file listed in your repository. It won’t actually exist on your computer yet as you will need to pull these changes back to your local repository, but more about that in the next section.\n \nWhether you followed Option 1 or Option 2 (or both) you have now successfully setup a version controlled RStudio project (and associated directory) and linked this to a GitHub repository. Git will now monitor this directory for any changes you make to files and also if you add or delete files. If the steps above seem like a bit of an ordeal, just remember, you only need to do this once for each project and it gets much easier over time.\n\n8.5.4 in VSCode\n\nto develop",

    "text": "8.6 Using Git with RStudio\nNow that we have our project and repositories (both local and remote) set up, it’s finally time to learn how to use Git in your IDE!\nTypically, when using Git your workflow will go something like this:\n\nYou create/delete and edit files in your project directory on your computer as usual (saving these changes as you go)\nOnce you’ve reached a natural ‘break point’ in your progress (i.e. you’d be sad if you lost this progress) you stage these files\nYou then commit the changes you made to these staged files (along with a useful commit message) which creates a permanent snapshot of these changes\nYou keep on with this cycle until you get to a point when you would like to push these changes to GitHub\nIf you’re working with other people on the same project you may also need to pull their changes to your local computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOK, let’s go through an example to help clarify this workflow.\nOpen up the first_repo.Rproj you created previously during Option 1. Either use the File -&gt; Open Project menu or click on the top right project icon and select the appropriate project.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCreate an R markdown document inside this project by clicking on the File -&gt; New File -&gt; R markdown menu (remember from the R markdown Chapter?).\nOnce created, we can delete all the example R markdown code (except the YAML header) as usual and write some interesting R markdown text and include a plot. We’ll use the inbuilt cars dataset to do this. Save this file (cmd + s for Mac or ctrl + s in Windows). Your R markdown document should look something like the following (it doesn’t matter if it’s not exactly the same).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTake a look at the ‘Git’ tab which should list your new R markdown document (first_doc.Rmd in this example) along with first_repo.Rproj, and .gitignore (you created these files previously when following Option 1).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFollowing our workflow, we now need to stage these files. To do this tick the boxes under the ‘Staged’ column for all files. Notice that there is a status icon next to the box which gives you an indication of how the files were changed. In our case all of the files are to be added (capital A) as we have just created them.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAfter you have staged the files the next step is to commit the files. This is done by clicking on the ‘Commit’ button.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nAfter clicking on the ‘Commit’ button you will be taken to the ‘Review Changes’ window. You should see the three files you staged from the previous step in the left pane. If you click on the file name first_doc.Rmd you will see the changes you have made to this file highlighted in the bottom pane. Any content that you have added is highlighted in green and deleted content is highlighted in red. As you have only just created this file, all the content is highlighted in green. To commit these files (take a snapshot) first enter a mandatory commit message in the ‘Commit message’ box. This message should be relatively short and informative (to you and your collaborators) and indicate why you made the changes, not what you changed. This makes sense as Git keeps track of what has changed and so it is best not to use commit messages for this purpose. It’s traditional to enter the message ‘First commit’ (or ‘Initial commit’) when you commit files for the first time. Now click on the ‘Commit’ button to commit these changes.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nA summary of the commit you just performed will be shown. Now click on the ‘Close’ button to return to the ‘Review Changes’ window. Note that the staged files have now been removed.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow that you have committed your changes the next step is to push these changes to GitHub. Before you push your changes it’s good practice to first pull any changes from GitHub. This is especially important if both you and your collaborators are working on the same files as it keeps you local copy up to date and avoids any potential conflicts. In this case your repository will already be up to date but it’s a good habit to get into. To do this, click on the ‘Pull’ button on the top right of the ‘Review Changes’ window. Once you have pulled any changes click on the green ‘Push’ button to push your changes. You will see a summary of the push you just performed. Hit the ‘Close’ button and then close the ‘Review Changes’ window.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo confirm the changes you made to the project have been pushed to GitHub, open your GitHub page, click on the Repositories link and then click on the first_repo repository. You should see four files listed including the first_doc.Rmd you just pushed. Along side the file name you will see your last commit message (‘First commit’ in this case) and when you made the last commit.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo see the contents of the file click on the first_doc.Rmd file name.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.1 Tracking changes\nAfter following the steps outlined above, you will have successfully modified an RStudio project by creating a new R markdown document, staged and then committed these changes and finally pushed the changes to your GitHub repository. Now let’s make some further changes to your R markdown file and follow the workflow once again but this time we ’ll take a look at how to identify changes made to files, examine the commit history and how to restore to a previous version of the document.\nIn RStudio open up the first_repo.Rproj file you created previously (if not already open) then open the first_doc.Rmd file (click on the file name in the Files tab in RStudio).\nLet’s make some changes to this document. Delete the line beginning with ‘My first version controlled …’ and replace it with something more informative (see figure below). We will also change the plotted symbols to red and give the plot axes labels. Lastly, let’s add a summary table of the dataframe using the kable() and summary() functions (you may need to install the knitr package if you haven’t done so previously to use the kable() function) and finally render this document to pdf by changing the YAML option to output: pdf_document.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow save these changes and then click the knit button to render to pdf. A new pdf file named first_doc.pdf will be created which you can view by clicking on the file name in the Files tab in RStudio.\nNotice that these two files have been added to the Git tab in RStudio. The status icons indicate that the first_doc.Rmd file has been modified (capital M) and the first_doc.pdf file is currently untracked (question mark).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo stage these files tick the ‘Staged’ box for each file and click on the ‘Commit’ button to take you to the ‘Review Changes’ window\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nBefore you commit your changes notice the status of first_doc.pdf has changed from untracked to added (A). You can view the changes you have made to the first_doc.Rmd by clicking on the file name in the top left pane which will provide you with a useful summary of the changes in the bottom pane (technically called diffs). Lines that have been deleted are highlighted in red and lines that have been added are highlighted in green (note that from Git’s point of view, a modification to a line is actually two operations: the removal of the original line followed by the creation of a new line). Once you’re happy, commit these changes by writing a suitable commit message and click on the ‘Commit’ button.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo push the changes to GitHub, click on the ‘Pull’ button first (remember this is good practice even though you are only collaborating with yourself at the moment) and then click on the ‘Push’ button. Go to your online GitHub repository and you will see your new commits, including the first_doc.pdf file you created when you rendered your R markdown document.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nTo view the changes in first_doc.Rmd click on the file name for this file.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Commit history\nOne of the great things about Git and GitHub is that you can view the history of all the commits you have made along with the associated commit messages. You can do this locally using RStudio (or the Git command line) or if you have pushed your commits to GitHub you can check them out on the GitHub website.\nTo view your commit history in RStudio click on the ‘History’ button (the one that looks like a clock) in the Git pane to bring up the history view in the ‘Review Changes’ window. You can also click on the ‘Commit’ or ‘Diff’ buttons which takes you to the same window (you just need to additionally click on the ‘History’ button in the ‘Review Changes’ window).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe history window is split into two parts. The top pane lists every commit you have made in this repository (with associated commit messages) starting with the most recent one at the top and oldest at the bottom. You can click on each of these commits and the bottom pane shows you the changes you have made along with a summary of the Date the commit was made, Author of the commit and the commit message (Subject). There is also a unique identifier for the commit (SHA - Secure Hash Algorithm) and a Parent SHA which identifies the previous commit. These SHA identifiers are really important as you can use them to view and revert to previous versions of files (details below). You can also view the contents of each file by clicking on the ‘View file @ SHA key` link (in our case ’View file @ 2b4693d1’).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can also view your commit history on GitHub website but this will be limited to only those commits you have already pushed to GitHub. To view the commit history navigate to the repository and click on the ‘commits’ link (in our case the link will be labelled ‘3 commits’ as we have made 3 commits).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou will see a list of all the commits you have made, along with commit messages, date of commit and the SHA identifier (these are the same SHA identifiers you saw in the RStudio history). You can even browse the repository at a particular point in time by clicking on the &lt;&gt; link. To view the changes in files associated with the commit simply click on the relevant commit link in the list.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhich will display changes using the usual format of green for additions and red for deletions.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.6.3 Reverting changes\nOne the great things about using Git is that you are able to revert to previous versions of files if you’ve made a mistake, broke something or just prefer and earlier approach. How you do this will depend on whether the changes you want to discard have been staged, committed or pushed to GitHub. We’ll go through some common scenarios below mostly using RStudio but occasionally we will need to resort to using the Terminal (still in RStudio though).\nChanges saved but not staged, committed or pushed\nIf you have saved changes to your file(s) but not staged, committed or pushed these files to GitHub you can right click on the offending file in the Git pane and select ‘Revert …’. This will roll back all of the changes you have made to the same state as your last commit. Just be aware that you cannot undo this operation so use with caution.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can also undo changes to just part of a file by opening up the ‘Diff’ window (click on the ‘Diff’ button in the Git pane). Select the line you wish to discard by double clicking on the line and then click on the ‘Discard line’ button. In a similar fashion you can discard chunks of code by clicking on the ‘Discard chunk’ button.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStaged but not committed and not pushed\nIf you have staged your files, but not committed them then simply unstage them by clicking on the ‘Staged’ check box in the Git pane (or in the ‘Review Changes’ window) to remove the tick. You can then revert all or parts of the file as described in the section above.\nStaged and committed but not pushed\nIf you have made a mistake or have forgotten to include a file in your last commit which you have not yet pushed to GitHub, you can just fix your mistake, save your changes, and then amend your previous commit. You can do this by staging your file and then tick the ‘Amend previous commit` box in the ’Review Changes’ window before committing.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf we check out our commit history you can see that our latest commit contains both changes to the file rather than having two separate commits. We use the amend commit approach alot but it’s important to understand that you should not do this if you have already pushed your last commit to GitHub as you are effectively rewriting history and all sorts bad things may happen!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nIf you spot a mistake that has happened multiple commits back or you just want to revert to a previous version of a document you have a number of options.\nOption 1 - (probably the easiest but very unGit - but like, whatever!) is to look in your commit history in RStudio, find the commit that you would like to go back to and click on the ‘View file @’ button to show the file contents.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nYou can then copy the contents of the file to the clipboard and paste it into your current file to replace your duff code or text. Alternatively, you can click on the ‘Save As’ button and save the file with a different file name. Once you have saved your new file you can delete your current unwanted file and then carry on working on your new file. Don’t forget to stage and commit this new file.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2 - (Git like) Go to your Git history, find the commit you would like to roll back to and write down (or copy) its SHA identifier.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNow go to the Terminal in RStudio and type git checkout &lt;SHA&gt; &lt;filename&gt;. In our case the SHA key is 2b4693d1 and the filename is first_doc.Rmd so our command would look like this:\ngit checkout 2b4693d1 first_doc.Rmd\nThe command above will copy the selected file version from the past and place it into the present. RStudio may ask you whether you want to reload the file as it now changed - select yes. You will also need to stage and commit the file as usual.\nIf you want to revert all your files to the same state as a previous commit rather than just one file you can use (the single ‘dot’ . is important otherwise your HEAD will detach!):\ngit rm -r .\ngit checkout 2b4693d1 .\n\nNote that this will delete all files that you have created since you made this commit so be careful!\nStaged, committed and pushed\nIf you have already pushed your commits to GitHub you can use the git checkout strategy described above and then commit and push to update GitHub (although this is not really considered ‘best’ practice). Another approach would be to use git revert (Note: as far as we can tell git revert is not the same as the ‘Revert’ option in RStudio). The revert command in Git essentially creates a new commit based on a previous commit and therefore preserves all of your commit history. To rollback to a previous state (commit) you first need to identify the SHA for the commit you wish to go back to (as we did above) and then use the revert command in the Terminal. Let’s say we want to revert back to our ‘First commit’ which has a SHA identifier d27e79f1.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWe can use the revert command as shown below in the Terminal. The --no-commit option is used to prevent us from having to deal with each intermediate commit.\ngit revert --no-commit d27e79f1..HEAD\nYour first_doc.Rmd file will now revert back to the same state as it was when you did your ‘First commit’. Notice also that the first_doc.pdf file has been deleted as this wasn’t present when we made our first commit. You can now stage and commit these files with a new commit message and finally push them to GitHub. Notice that if we look at our commit history all of the commits we have made are still present.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nand our repo on GitHub also reflects these changes",

    "text": "8.7 Using Git with VSCode\nNow that we have our project and repositories (both local and remote) set up, it’s finally time to learn how to use Git in VSCode!\nTypically, when using Git your workflow will go something like this:\n\nYou create/delete and edit files in your project directory on your computer as usual (saving these changes as you go)\nOnce you’ve reached a natural ‘break point’ in your progress (i.e. you’d be sad if you lost this progress) you stage these files\nYou then commit the changes you made to these staged files (along with a useful commit message) which creates a permanent snapshot of these changes\nYou keep on with this cycle until you get to a point when you would like to push these changes to GitHub\nIf you’re working with other people on the same project you may also need to pull their changes to your local computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOK, let’s go through an example to help clarify this workflow.\nTracking changes\nCommit History\nReverting changes",

    "text": "8.8 Collaborate with Git\nGitHub is a great tool for collaboration, it can seem scary and complicated at first, but it is worth investing some time to learn how it works. What makes GitHub so good for collaboration is that it is a distributed system, which means that every collaborator works on their own copy of the project and changes are then merged together in the remote repository. There are two main ways you can set up a collaborative project on GitHub. One is the workflow we went through above, where everybody connects their local repository to the same remote one; this system works well with small projects where different people mainly work on different aspects of the project but can quickly become unwieldy if many people are collaborating and are working on the same files (merge misery!). The second approach consists of every collaborator creating a copy (or fork) of the main repository, which becomes their remote repository. Every collaborator then needs to send a request (a pull request) to the owner of the main repository to incorporate any changes into the main repository and this includes a review process before the changes are integrated. More detail of these topics can be found in the Further resources section.",

    "text": "8.9 Git tips\nGenerally speaking you should commit often (including amended commits) but push much less often. This makes collaboration easier and also makes the process of reverting to previous versions of documents much more straight forward. We generally only push changes to GitHub when we’re happy for our collaborators (or the rest of the world) to see our work. However, this is entirely up to you and depends on the project (and who you are working with) and what your priorities are when using Git.\n \nIf you don’t want to track a file in your repository (maybe they are too large or transient files) you can get Git to ignore the file by adding it to the .gitignore file. On RStudio, in the git pane, you can right clicking on the filename to exclude and selecting ‘Ignore…’\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThis will add the filename to the .gitignore file. If you want to ignore multiple files or a particular type of file you can also include wildcards in the .gitignore file. For example to ignore all png files you can include the expression *.png in your .gitignore file and save.\n \nIf it all goes pear shaped and you end up completely trashing your Git repository don’t despair (we’ve all been there!). As long as your GitHub repository is good, all you need to do is delete the offending project directory on your computer, create a new RStudio project and link this with your remote GitHub repository using Option 2. Once you have cloned the remote repository you should be good to go.",
